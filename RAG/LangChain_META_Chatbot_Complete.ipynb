\\n\\nPython is the main dynamic language used at Google. This style guide is a list\\nof *dos and don\\'ts* for Python programs.\\n\\nTo help you format code correctly, we\\'ve created a [settings file for Vim](google_python_style.vim). For Emacs, the default settings should be fine.\\n\\nMany teams use the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) or [Pyink](https://github.com/google/pyink)\\nauto-formatter to avoid arguing over formatting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 2 Python Language Rules \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.1 Lint \\n\\nRun `pylint` over your code using this [pylintrc](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pylintrc).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.1.1 Definition \\n\\n`pylint`\\nis a tool for finding bugs and style problems in Python source code. It finds\\nproblems that are typically caught by a compiler for less dynamic languages like\\nC and C++. Because of the dynamic nature of Python, some\\nwarnings may be incorrect; however, spurious warnings should be fairly\\ninfrequent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.1.2 Pros \\n\\nCatches easy-to-miss errors like typos, using-vars-before-assignment, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.1.3 Cons \\n\\n`pylint`\\nisn\\'t perfect. To take advantage of it, sometimes we\\'ll need to write around it,\\nsuppress its warnings or fix it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.1.4 Decision \\n\\nMake sure you run\\n`pylint`\\non your code.\\n\\n\\nSuppress warnings if they are inappropriate so that other issues are not hidden.\\nTo suppress warnings, you can set a line-level comment:\\n\\n```python\\ndef do_PUT(self):  # WSGI name, so pylint: disable=invalid-name\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n`pylint`\\nwarnings are each identified by symbolic name (`empty-docstring`)\\nGoogle-specific warnings start with `g-`.\\n\\nIf the reason for the suppression is not clear from the symbolic name, add an\\nexplanation.\\n\\nSuppressing in this way has the advantage that we can easily search for\\nsuppressions and revisit them.\\n\\nYou can get a list of\\n`pylint`\\nwarnings by doing:\\n\\n```shell\\npylint --list-msgs\\n```\\n\\nTo get more information on a particular message, use:\\n\\n```shell\\npylint --help-msg=invalid-name\\n```\\n\\nPrefer `pylint: disable` to the deprecated older form `pylint: disable-msg`.\\n\\nUnused argument warnings can be suppressed by deleting the variables at the\\nbeginning of the function. Always include a comment explaining why you are\\ndeleting it. \"Unused.\" is sufficient. For example:\\n\\n```python\\ndef viking_cafe_order(spam: str, beans: str, eggs: str | None = None) -> str:\\n    del beans, eggs  # Unused by vikings.\\n    return spam + spam + spam\\n```\\n\\nOther common forms of suppressing this warning include using \\'`_`\\' as the\\nidentifier for the unused argument or prefixing the argument name with\\n\\'`unused_`\\', or assigning them to \\'`_`\\'. These forms are allowed but no longer\\nencouraged. These break callers that pass arguments by name and do not enforce\\nthat the arguments are actually unused.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.2 Imports \\n\\nUse `import` statements for packages and modules only, not for individual types,\\nclasses, or functions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.2.1 Definition \\n\\nReusability mechanism for sharing code from one module to another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.2.2 Pros \\n\\nThe namespace management convention is simple. The source of each identifier is\\nindicated in a consistent way; `x.Obj` says that object `Obj` is defined in\\nmodule `x`.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.2.3 Cons \\n\\nModule names can still collide. Some module names are inconveniently long.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.2.4 Decision \\n\\n*   Use `import x` for importing packages and modules.\\n*   Use `from x import y` where `x` is the package prefix and `y` is the module\\n    name with no prefix.\\n*   Use `from x import y as z` in any of the following circumstances:\\n    -   Two modules named `y` are to be imported.\\n    -   `y` conflicts with a top-level name defined in the current module.\\n    -   `y` conflicts with a common parameter name that is part of the public\\n        API (e.g., `features`).\\n    -   `y` is an inconveniently long name.\\n    -   `y` is too generic in the context of your code (e.g., `from\\n        storage.file_system import options as fs_options`).\\n*   Use `import y as z` only when `z` is a standard abbreviation (e.g., `import\\n    numpy as np`).\\n\\nFor example the module `sound.effects.echo` may be imported as follows:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom sound.effects import echo\\n...\\necho.EchoFilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)\\n```\\n\\nDo not use relative names in imports. Even if the module is in the same package,\\nuse the full package name. This helps prevent unintentionally importing a\\npackage twice.\\n\\n\\n##### 2.2.4.1 Exemptions \\n\\nExemptions from this rule:\\n\\n*   Symbols from the following modules are used to support static analysis and\\n    type checking:\\n    *   [`typing` module](#typing-imports)\\n    *   [`collections.abc` module](#typing-imports)\\n    *   [`typing_extensions` module](https://github.com/python/typing_extensions/blob/main/README.md)\\n*   Redirects from the\\n    [six.moves module](https://six.readthedocs.io/#module-six.moves).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.3 Packages \\n\\nImport each module using the full pathname location of the module.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.3.1 Pros \\n\\nAvoids conflicts in module names or incorrect imports due to the module search\\npath not being what the author expected. Makes it easier to find modules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.3.2 Cons \\n\\nMakes it harder to deploy code because you have to replicate the package\\nhierarchy. Not really a problem with modern deployment mechanisms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.3.3 Decision \\n\\nAll new code should import each module by its full package name.\\n\\nImports should be as follows:\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\n  # Reference absl.flags in code with the complete name (verbose).\\n  import absl.flags\\n  from doctor.who import jodie\\n\\n  _FOO = absl.flags.DEFINE_string(...)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\n  # Reference flags in code with just the module name (common).\\n  from absl import flags\\n  from doctor.who import jodie\\n\\n  _FOO = flags.DEFINE_string(...)\\n```\\n\\n*(assume this file lives in `doctor/who/` where `jodie.py` also exists)*\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\n  # Unclear what module the author wanted and what will be imported.  The actual\\n  # import behavior depends on external factors controlling sys.path.\\n  # Which possible jodie module did the author intend to import?\\n  import jodie\\n```\\n\\nThe directory the main binary is located in should not be assumed to be in\\n`sys.path` despite that happening in some environments. This being the case,\\ncode should assume that `import jodie` refers to a third-party or top-level\\npackage named `jodie`, not a local `jodie.py`.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.4 Exceptions \\n\\nExceptions are allowed but must be used carefully.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.4.1 Definition \\n\\nExceptions are a means of breaking out of normal control flow to handle errors\\nor other exceptional conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.4.2 Pros \\n\\nThe control flow of normal operation code is not cluttered by error-handling\\ncode. It also allows the control flow to skip multiple frames when a certain\\ncondition occurs, e.g., returning from N nested functions in one step instead of\\nhaving to plumb error codes through.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.4.3 Cons \\n\\nMay cause the control flow to be confusing. Easy to miss error cases when making\\nlibrary calls.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.4.4 Decision \\n\\nExceptions must follow certain conditions:\\n\\n-   Make use of built-in exception classes when it makes sense. For example,\\n    raise a `ValueError` to indicate a programming mistake like a violated\\n    precondition, such as may happen when validating function arguments.\\n\\n-   Do not use `assert` statements in place of conditionals or validating\\n    preconditions. They must not be critical to the application logic. A litmus\\n    test would be that the `assert` could be removed without breaking the code.\\n    `assert` conditionals are\\n    [not guaranteed](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement)\\n    to be evaluated. For [pytest](https://pytest.org) based tests, `assert` is\\n    okay and expected to verify expectations. For\\n    example:\\n\\n    \\n    ```python\\n    Yes:\\n      def connect_to_next_port(self, minimum: int) -> int:\\n        \"\"\"Connects to the next available port.\\n\\n        Args:\\n          minimum: A port value greater or equal to 1024.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n          The new minimum port.\\n\\n        Raises:\\n          ConnectionError: If no available port is found.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        if minimum < 1024:\\n          # Note that this raising of ValueError is not mentioned in the doc\\n          # string\\'s \"Raises:\" section because it is not appropriate to\\n          # guarantee this specific behavioral reaction to API misuse.\\n          raise ValueError(f\\'Min. port must be at least 1024, not {minimum}.\\')\\n        port = self._find_next_open_port(minimum)\\n        if port is None:\\n          raise ConnectionError(\\n              f\\'Could not connect to service on port {minimum} or higher.\\')\\n        # The code does not depend on the result of this assert.\\n        assert port >= minimum, (\\n            f\\'Unexpected port {port} when minimum was {minimum}.\\')\\n        return port\\n    ```\\n\\n    ```python\\n    No:\\n      def connect_to_next_port(self, minimum: int) -> int:\\n        \"\"\"Connects to the next available port.\\n\\n        Args:\\n          minimum: A port value greater or equal to 1024.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n          The new minimum port.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        assert minimum >= 1024, \\'Minimum port must be at least 1024.\\'\\n        # The following code depends on the previous assert.\\n        port = self._find_next_open_port(minimum)\\n        assert port is not None\\n        # The type checking of the return statement relies on the assert.\\n        return port\\n    ```\\n\\n\\n-   Libraries or packages may define their own exceptions. When doing so they\\n    must inherit from an existing exception class. Exception names should end in\\n    `Error` and should not introduce repetition (`foo.FooError`).\\n\\n-   Never use catch-all `except:` statements, or catch `Exception` or\\n    `StandardError`, unless you are\\n\\n    -   re-raising the exception, or\\n    -   creating an isolation point in the program where exceptions are not\\n        propagated but are recorded and suppressed instead, such as protecting a\\n        thread from crashing by guarding its outermost block.\\n\\n    Python is very tolerant in this regard and `except:` will really catch\\n    everything including misspelled names, sys.exit() calls, Ctrl+C interrupts,\\n    unittest failures and all kinds of other exceptions that you simply don\\'t\\n    want to catch.\\n\\n-   Minimize the amount of code in a `try`/`except` block. The larger the body\\n    of the `try`, the more likely that an exception will be raised by a line of\\n    code that you didn\\'t expect to raise an exception. In those cases, the\\n    `try`/`except` block hides a real error.\\n\\n-   Use the `finally` clause to execute code whether or not an exception is\\n    raised in the `try` block. This is often useful for cleanup, i.e., closing a\\n    file.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.5 Mutable Global State \\n\\nAvoid mutable global state.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.5.1 Definition \\n\\nModule-level values or class attributes that can get mutated during program\\nexecution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.5.2 Pros \\n\\nOccasionally useful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.5.3 Cons \\n\\n*   Breaks encapsulation: Such design can make it hard to achieve valid\\n    objectives. For example, if global state is used to manage a database\\n    connection, then connecting to two different databases at the same time\\n    (such as for computing differences during a migration) becomes difficult.\\n    Similar problems easily arise with global registries.\\n\\n*   Has the potential to change module behavior during the import, because\\n    assignments to global variables are done when the module is first imported.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.5.4 Decision \\n\\nAvoid mutable global state.\\n\\nIn those rare cases where using global state is warranted, mutable global\\nentities should be declared at the module level or as a class attribute and made\\ninternal by prepending an `_` to the name. If necessary, external access to\\nmutable global state must be done through public functions or class methods. See\\n[Naming](#s3.16-naming) below. Please explain the design reasons why mutable\\nglobal state is being used in a comment or a doc linked to from a comment.\\n\\nModule-level constants are permitted and encouraged. For example:\\n`_MAX_HOLY_HANDGRENADE_COUNT = 3` for an internal use constant or\\n`SIR_LANCELOTS_FAVORITE_COLOR = \"blue\"` for a public API constant. Constants\\nmust be named using all caps with underscores. See [Naming](#s3.16-naming)\\nbelow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.6 Nested/Local/Inner Classes and Functions \\n\\nNested local functions or classes are fine when used to close over a local\\nvariable. Inner classes are fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.6.1 Definition \\n\\nA class can be defined inside of a method, function, or class. A function can be\\ndefined inside a method or function. Nested functions have read-only access to\\nvariables defined in enclosing scopes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.6.2 Pros \\n\\nAllows definition of utility classes and functions that are only used inside of\\na very limited scope. Very\\n[ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type)-y. Commonly used for\\nimplementing decorators.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.6.3 Cons \\n\\nNested functions and classes cannot be directly tested. Nesting can make the\\nouter function longer and less readable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.6.4 Decision \\n\\nThey are fine with some caveats. Avoid nested functions or classes except when\\nclosing over a local value other than `self` or `cls`. Do not nest a function\\njust to hide it from users of a module. Instead, prefix its name with an \\\\_ at\\nthe module level so that it can still be accessed by tests.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.7 Comprehensions & Generator Expressions \\n\\nOkay to use for simple cases.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.7.1 Definition \\n\\nList, Dict, and Set comprehensions as well as generator expressions provide a\\nconcise and efficient way to create container types and iterators without\\nresorting to the use of traditional loops, `map()`, `filter()`, or `lambda`.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.7.2 Pros \\n\\nSimple comprehensions can be clearer and simpler than other dict, list, or set\\ncreation techniques. Generator expressions can be very efficient, since they\\navoid the creation of a list entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.7.3 Cons \\n\\nComplicated comprehensions or generator expressions can be hard to read.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.7.4 Decision \\n\\nComprehensions are allowed, however multiple `for` clauses or filter expressions\\nare not permitted. Optimize for readability, not conciseness.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\n  result = [mapping_expr for value in iterable if filter_expr]\\n\\n  result = [\\n      is_valid(metric={\\'key\\': value})\\n      for value in interesting_iterable\\n      if a_longer_filter_expression(value)\\n  ]\\n\\n  descriptive_name = [\\n      transform({\\'key\\': key, \\'value\\': value}, color=\\'black\\')\\n      for key, value in generate_iterable(some_input)\\n      if complicated_condition_is_met(key, value)\\n  ]\\n\\n  result = []\\n  for x in range(10):\\n    for y in range(5):\\n      if x * y > 10:\\n        result.append((x, y))\\n\\n  return {\\n      x: complicated_transform(x)\\n      for x in long_generator_function(parameter)\\n      if x is not None\\n  }\\n\\n  return (x**2 for x in range(10))\\n\\n  unique_names = {user.name for user in users if user is not None}\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\n  result = [(x, y) for x in range(10) for y in range(5) if x * y > 10]\\n\\n  return (\\n      (x, y, z)\\n      for x in range(5)\\n      for y in range(5)\\n      if x != y\\n      for z in range(5)\\n      if y != z\\n  )\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.8 Default Iterators and Operators \\n\\nUse default iterators and operators for types that support them, like lists,\\ndictionaries, and files.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.8.1 Definition \\n\\nContainer types, like dictionaries and lists, define default iterators and\\nmembership test operators (\"in\" and \"not in\").\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.8.2 Pros \\n\\nThe default iterators and operators are simple and efficient. They express the\\noperation directly, without extra method calls. A function that uses default\\noperators is generic. It can be used with any type that supports the operation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.8.3 Cons \\n\\nYou can\\'t tell the type of objects by reading the method names (unless the\\nvariable has type annotations). This is also an advantage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.8.4 Decision \\n\\nUse default iterators and operators for types that support them, like lists,\\ndictionaries, and files. The built-in types define iterator methods, too. Prefer\\nthese methods to methods that return lists, except that you should not mutate a\\ncontainer while iterating over it.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:  for key in adict: ...\\n      if obj in alist: ...\\n      for line in afile: ...\\n      for k, v in adict.items(): ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:   for key in adict.keys(): ...\\n      for line in afile.readlines(): ...\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.9 Generators \\n\\nUse generators as needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.9.1 Definition \\n\\nA generator function returns an iterator that yields a value each time it\\nexecutes a yield statement. After it yields a value, the runtime state of the\\ngenerator function is suspended until the next value is needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.9.2 Pros \\n\\nSimpler code, because the state of local variables and control flow are\\npreserved for each call. A generator uses less memory than a function that\\ncreates an entire list of values at once.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.9.3 Cons \\n\\nLocal variables in the generator will not be garbage collected until the\\ngenerator is either consumed to exhaustion or itself garbage collected.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.9.4 Decision \\n\\nFine. Use \"Yields:\" rather than \"Returns:\" in the docstring for generator\\nfunctions.\\n\\nIf the generator manages an expensive resource, make sure to force the clean up.\\n\\nA good way to do the clean up is by wrapping the generator with a context\\nmanager [PEP-0533](https://peps.python.org/pep-0533/).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.10 Lambda Functions \\n\\nOkay for one-liners. Prefer generator expressions over `map()` or `filter()`\\nwith a `lambda`.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.10.1 Definition \\n\\nLambdas define anonymous functions in an expression, as opposed to a statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.10.2 Pros \\n\\nConvenient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.10.3 Cons \\n\\nHarder to read and debug than local functions. The lack of names means stack\\ntraces are more difficult to understand. Expressiveness is limited because the\\nfunction may only contain an expression.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.10.4 Decision \\n\\nLambdas are allowed. If the code inside the lambda function spans multiple lines\\nor is longer than 60-80 chars, it might be better to define it as a regular\\n[nested function](#lexical-scoping).\\n\\nFor common operations like multiplication, use the functions from the `operator`\\nmodule instead of lambda functions. For example, prefer `operator.mul` to\\n`lambda x, y: x * y`.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.11 Conditional Expressions \\n\\nOkay for simple cases.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.11.1 Definition \\n\\nConditional expressions (sometimes called a “ternary operator”) are mechanisms\\nthat provide a shorter syntax for if statements. For example: `x = 1 if cond\\nelse 2`.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.11.2 Pros \\n\\nShorter and more convenient than an if statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.11.3 Cons \\n\\nMay be harder to read than an if statement. The condition may be difficult to\\nlocate if the expression is long.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.11.4 Decision \\n\\nOkay to use for simple cases. Each portion must fit on one line:\\ntrue-expression, if-expression, else-expression. Use a complete if statement\\nwhen things get more complicated.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\n    one_line = \\'yes\\' if predicate(value) else \\'no\\'\\n    slightly_split = (\\'yes\\' if predicate(value)\\n                      else \\'no, nein, nyet\\')\\n    the_longest_ternary_style_that_can_be_done = (\\n        \\'yes, true, affirmative, confirmed, correct\\'\\n        if predicate(value)\\n        else \\'no, false, negative, nay\\')\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\n    bad_line_breaking = (\\'yes\\' if predicate(value) else\\n                         \\'no\\')\\n    portion_too_long = (\\'yes\\'\\n                        if some_long_module.some_long_predicate_function(\\n                            really_long_variable_name)\\n                        else \\'no, false, negative, nay\\')\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.12 Default Argument Values \\n\\nOkay in most cases.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.12.1 Definition \\n\\nYou can specify values for variables at the end of a function\\'s parameter list,\\ne.g., `def foo(a, b=0):`. If `foo` is called with only one argument, `b` is set\\nto 0. If it is called with two arguments, `b` has the value of the second\\nargument.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.12.2 Pros \\n\\nOften you have a function that uses lots of default values, but on rare\\noccasions you want to override the defaults. Default argument values provide an\\neasy way to do this, without having to define lots of functions for the rare\\nexceptions. As Python does not support overloaded methods/functions, default\\narguments are an easy way of \"faking\" the overloading behavior.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.12.3 Cons \\n\\nDefault arguments are evaluated once at module load time. This may cause\\nproblems if the argument is a mutable object such as a list or a dictionary. If\\nthe function modifies the object (e.g., by appending an item to a list), the\\ndefault value is modified.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.12.4 Decision \\n\\nOkay to use with the following caveat:\\n\\nDo not use mutable objects as default values in the function or method\\ndefinition.\\n\\n```python\\nYes: def foo(a, b=None):\\n         if b is None:\\n             b = []\\nYes: def foo(a, b: Sequence | None = None):\\n         if b is None:\\n             b = []\\nYes: def foo(a, b: Sequence = ()):  # Empty tuple OK since tuples are immutable.\\n         ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nfrom absl import flags\\n_FOO = flags.DEFINE_string(...)\\n\\nNo:  def foo(a, b=[]):\\n         ...\\nNo:  def foo(a, b=time.time()):  # Is `b` supposed to represent when this module was loaded?\\n         ...\\nNo:  def foo(a, b=_FOO.value):  # sys.argv has not yet been parsed...\\n         ...\\nNo:  def foo(a, b: Mapping = {}):  # Could still get passed to unchecked code.\\n         ...\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.13 Properties \\n\\nProperties may be used to control getting or setting attributes that require\\ntrivial computations or logic. Property implementations must match the general\\nexpectations of regular attribute access: that they are cheap, straightforward,\\nand unsurprising.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.13.1 Definition \\n\\nA way to wrap method calls for getting and setting an attribute as a standard\\nattribute access.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.13.2 Pros \\n\\n*   Allows for an attribute access and assignment API rather than\\n    [getter and setter](#getters-and-setters) method calls.\\n*   Can be used to make an attribute read-only.\\n*   Allows calculations to be lazy.\\n*   Provides a way to maintain the public interface of a class when the\\n    internals evolve independently of class users.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.13.3 Cons \\n\\n*   Can hide side-effects much like operator overloading.\\n*   Can be confusing for subclasses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.13.4 Decision \\n\\nProperties are allowed, but, like operator overloading, should only be used when\\nnecessary and match the expectations of typical attribute access; follow the\\n[getters and setters](#getters-and-setters) rules otherwise.\\n\\nFor example, using a property to simply both get and set an internal attribute\\nisn\\'t allowed: there is no computation occurring, so the property is unnecessary\\n([make the attribute public instead](#getters-and-setters)). In comparison,\\nusing a property to control attribute access or to calculate a *trivially*\\nderived value is allowed: the logic is simple and unsurprising.\\n\\nProperties should be created with the `@property`\\n[decorator](#s2.17-function-and-method-decorators). Manually implementing a\\nproperty descriptor is considered a [power feature](#power-features).\\n\\nInheritance with properties can be non-obvious. Do not use properties to\\nimplement computations a subclass may ever want to override and extend.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.14 True/False Evaluations \\n\\nUse the \"implicit\" false if at all possible (with a few caveats).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.14.1 Definition \\n\\nPython evaluates certain values as `False` when in a boolean context. A quick\\n\"rule of thumb\" is that all \"empty\" values are considered false, so `0, None,\\n[], {}, \\'\\'` all evaluate as false in a boolean context.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.14.2 Pros \\n\\nConditions using Python booleans are easier to read and less error-prone. In\\nmost cases, they\\'re also faster.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.14.3 Cons \\n\\nMay look strange to C/C++ developers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.14.4 Decision \\n\\nUse the \"implicit\" false if possible, e.g., `if foo:` rather than `if foo !=\\n[]:`. There are a few caveats that you should keep in mind though:\\n\\n-   Always use `if foo is None:` (or `is not None`) to check for a `None` value.\\n    E.g., when testing whether a variable or argument that defaults to `None`\\n    was set to some other value. The other value might be a value that\\'s false\\n    in a boolean context!\\n\\n-   Never compare a boolean variable to `False` using `==`. Use `if not x:`\\n    instead. If you need to distinguish `False` from `None` then chain the\\n    expressions, such as `if not x and x is not None:`.\\n\\n-   For sequences (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty sequences\\n    are false, so `if seq:` and `if not seq:` are preferable to `if len(seq):`\\n    and `if not len(seq):` respectively.\\n\\n-   When handling integers, implicit false may involve more risk than benefit\\n    (i.e., accidentally handling `None` as 0). You may compare a value which is\\n    known to be an integer (and is not the result of `len()`) against the\\n    integer 0.\\n\\n    ```python\\n    Yes: if not users:\\n             print(\\'no users\\')\\n\\n         if i % 10 == 0:\\n             self.handle_multiple_of_ten()\\n\\n         def f(x=None):\\n             if x is None:\\n                 x = []\\n    ```\\n\\n    ```python\\n    No:  if len(users) == 0:\\n             print(\\'no users\\')\\n\\n         if not i % 10:\\n             self.handle_multiple_of_ten()\\n\\n         def f(x=None):\\n             x = x or []\\n    ```\\n\\n-   Note that `\\'0\\'` (i.e., `0` as string) evaluates to true.\\n\\n-   Note that Numpy arrays may raise an exception in an implicit boolean\\n    context. Prefer the `.size` attribute when testing emptiness of a `np.array`\\n    (e.g. `if not users.size`).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.16 Lexical Scoping \\n\\nOkay to use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.16.1 Definition \\n\\nA nested Python function can refer to variables defined in enclosing functions,\\nbut cannot assign to them. Variable bindings are resolved using lexical scoping,\\nthat is, based on the static program text. Any assignment to a name in a block\\nwill cause Python to treat all references to that name as a local variable, even\\nif the use precedes the assignment. If a global declaration occurs, the name is\\ntreated as a global variable.\\n\\nAn example of the use of this feature is:\\n\\n```python\\ndef get_adder(summand1: float) -> Callable[[float], float]:\\n    \"\"\"Returns a function that adds numbers to a given number.\"\"\"\\n    def adder(summand2: float) -> float:\\n        return summand1 + summand2\\n\\n    return adder\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.16.2 Pros \\n\\nOften results in clearer, more elegant code. Especially comforting to\\nexperienced Lisp and Scheme (and Haskell and ML and ...) programmers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.16.3 Cons \\n\\nCan lead to confusing bugs, such as this example based on\\n[PEP-0227](https://peps.python.org/pep-0227/):\\n\\n```python\\ni = 4\\ndef foo(x: Iterable[int]):\\n    def bar():\\n        print(i, end=\\'\\')\\n    # ...\\n    # A bunch of code here\\n    # ...\\n    for i in x:  # Ah, i *is* local to foo, so this is what bar sees\\n        print(i, end=\\'\\')\\n    bar()\\n```\\n\\nSo `foo([1, 2, 3])` will print `1 2 3 3`,\\nnot `1 2 3 4`.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.16.4 Decision \\n\\nOkay to use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.17 Function and Method Decorators \\n\\nUse decorators judiciously when there is a clear advantage. Avoid `staticmethod`\\nand limit use of `classmethod`.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.17.1 Definition \\n\\n[Decorators for Functions and Methods](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator)\\n(a.k.a \"the `@` notation\"). One common decorator is `@property`, used for\\nconverting ordinary methods into dynamically computed attributes. However, the\\ndecorator syntax allows for user-defined decorators as well. Specifically, for\\nsome function `my_decorator`, this:\\n\\n```python\\nclass C:\\n    @my_decorator\\n    def method(self):\\n        # method body ...\\n```\\n\\nis equivalent to:\\n\\n```python\\nclass C:\\n    def method(self):\\n        # method body ...\\n    method = my_decorator(method)\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.17.2 Pros \\n\\nElegantly specifies some transformation on a method; the transformation might\\neliminate some repetitive code, enforce invariants, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.17.3 Cons \\n\\nDecorators can perform arbitrary operations on a function\\'s arguments or return\\nvalues, resulting in surprising implicit behavior. Additionally, decorators\\nexecute at object definition time. For module-level objects (classes, module\\nfunctions, ...) this happens at import time. Failures in decorator code are\\npretty much impossible to recover from.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.17.4 Decision \\n\\nUse decorators judiciously when there is a clear advantage. Decorators should\\nfollow the same import and naming guidelines as functions. A decorator docstring\\nshould clearly state that the function is a decorator. Write unit tests for\\ndecorators.\\n\\nAvoid external dependencies in the decorator itself (e.g. don\\'t rely on files,\\nsockets, database connections, etc.), since they might not be available when the\\ndecorator runs (at import time, perhaps from `pydoc` or other tools). A\\ndecorator that is called with valid parameters should (as much as possible) be\\nguaranteed to succeed in all cases.\\n\\nDecorators are a special case of \"top-level code\" - see [main](#s3.17-main) for\\nmore discussion.\\n\\nNever use `staticmethod` unless forced to in order to integrate with an API\\ndefined in an existing library. Write a module-level function instead.\\n\\nUse `classmethod` only when writing a named constructor, or a class-specific\\nroutine that modifies necessary global state such as a process-wide cache.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.18 Threading \\n\\nDo not rely on the atomicity of built-in types.\\n\\nWhile Python\\'s built-in data types such as dictionaries appear to have atomic\\noperations, there are corner cases where they aren\\'t atomic (e.g. if `__hash__`\\nor `__eq__` are implemented as Python methods) and their atomicity should not be\\nrelied upon. Neither should you rely on atomic variable assignment (since this\\nin turn depends on dictionaries).\\n\\nUse the `queue` module\\'s `Queue` data type as the preferred way to communicate\\ndata between threads. Otherwise, use the `threading` module and its locking\\nprimitives. Prefer condition variables and `threading.Condition` instead of\\nusing lower-level locks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.19 Power Features \\n\\nAvoid these features.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.19.1 Definition \\n\\nPython is an extremely flexible language and gives you many fancy features such\\nas custom metaclasses, access to bytecode, on-the-fly compilation, dynamic\\ninheritance, object reparenting, import hacks, reflection (e.g. some uses of\\n`getattr()`), modification of system internals, `__del__` methods implementing\\ncustomized cleanup, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.19.2 Pros \\n\\nThese are powerful language features. They can make your code more compact.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.19.3 Cons \\n\\nIt\\'s very tempting to use these \"cool\" features when they\\'re not absolutely\\nnecessary. It\\'s harder to read, understand, and debug code that\\'s using unusual\\nfeatures underneath. It doesn\\'t seem that way at first (to the original author),\\nbut when revisiting the code, it tends to be more difficult than code that is\\nlonger but is straightforward.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.19.4 Decision \\n\\nAvoid these features in your code.\\n\\nStandard library modules and classes that internally use these features are okay\\nto use (for example, `abc.ABCMeta`, `dataclasses`, and `enum`).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.20 Modern Python: from \\\\_\\\\_future\\\\_\\\\_ imports \\n\\nNew language version semantic changes may be gated behind a special future\\nimport to enable them on a per-file basis within earlier runtimes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.20.1 Definition \\n\\nBeing able to turn on some of the more modern features via `from __future__\\nimport` statements allows early use of features from expected future Python\\nversions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.20.2 Pros \\n\\nThis has proven to make runtime version upgrades smoother as changes can be made\\non a per-file basis while declaring compatibility and preventing regressions\\nwithin those files. Modern code is more maintainable as it is less likely to\\naccumulate technical debt that will be problematic during future runtime\\nupgrades.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.20.3 Cons \\n\\nSuch code may not work on very old interpreter versions prior to the\\nintroduction of the needed future statement. The need for this is more common in\\nprojects supporting an extremely wide variety of environments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.20.4 Decision \\n\\n##### from \\\\_\\\\_future\\\\_\\\\_ imports\\n\\nUse of `from __future__ import` statements is encouraged. It allows a given\\nsource file to start using more modern Python syntax features today. Once you no\\nlonger need to run on a version where the features are hidden behind a\\n`__future__` import, feel free to remove those lines.\\n\\nIn code that may execute on versions as old as 3.5 rather than >= 3.7, import:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom __future__ import generator_stop\\n```\\n\\nFor more information read the\\n[Python future statement definitions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html)\\ndocumentation.\\n\\nPlease don\\'t remove these imports until you are confident the code is only ever\\nused in a sufficiently modern environment. Even if you do not currently use the\\nfeature a specific future import enables in your code today, keeping it in place\\nin the file prevents later modifications of the code from inadvertently\\ndepending on the older behavior.\\n\\nUse other `from __future__` import statements as you see fit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 2.21 Type Annotated Code \\n\\nYou can annotate Python code with\\n[type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). Type-check the code\\nat build time with a type checking tool like [pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype).\\nIn most cases, when feasible, type annotations are in source files. For\\nthird-party or extension modules, annotations can be in\\n[stub `.pyi` files](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#stub-files).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.21.1 Definition \\n\\nType annotations (or \"type hints\") are for function or method arguments and\\nreturn values:\\n\\n```python\\ndef func(a: int) -> list[int]:\\n```\\n\\nYou can also declare the type of a variable using similar syntax:\\n\\n```python\\na: SomeType = some_func()\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.21.2 Pros \\n\\nType annotations improve the readability and maintainability of your code. The\\ntype checker will convert many runtime errors to build-time errors, and reduce\\nyour ability to use [Power Features](#power-features).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.21.3 Cons \\n\\nYou will have to keep the type declarations up to date.\\nYou might see type errors that you think are\\nvalid code. Use of a\\n[type checker](https://github.com/google/pytype)\\nmay reduce your ability to use [Power Features](#power-features).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 2.21.4 Decision \\n\\nYou are strongly encouraged to enable Python type analysis when updating code.\\nWhen adding or modifying public APIs, include type annotations and enable\\nchecking via pytype in the build system. As static analysis is relatively new to\\nPython, we acknowledge that undesired side-effects (such as\\nwrongly\\ninferred types) may prevent adoption by some projects. In those situations,\\nauthors are encouraged to add a comment with a TODO or link to a bug describing\\nthe issue(s) currently preventing type annotation adoption in the BUILD file or\\nin the code itself as appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 3 Python Style Rules \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.1 Semicolons \\n\\nDo not terminate your lines with semicolons, and do not use semicolons to put\\ntwo statements on the same line.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.2 Line length \\n\\nMaximum line length is *80 characters*.\\n\\nExplicit exceptions to the 80 character limit:\\n\\n-   Long import statements.\\n-   URLs, pathnames, or long flags in comments.\\n-   Long string module-level constants not containing whitespace that would be\\n    inconvenient to split across lines such as URLs or pathnames.\\n    -   Pylint disable comments. (e.g.: `# pylint: disable=invalid-name`)\\n\\nDo not use a backslash for\\n[explicit line continuation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#explicit-line-joining).\\n\\nInstead, make use of Python\\'s\\n[implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces](http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical_analysis.html#implicit-line-joining).\\nIf necessary, you can add an extra pair of parentheses around an expression.\\n\\nNote that this rule doesn\\'t prohibit backslash-escaped newlines within strings\\n(see [below](#strings)).\\n\\n```python\\nYes: foo_bar(self, width, height, color=\\'black\\', design=None, x=\\'foo\\',\\n             emphasis=None, highlight=0)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n\\nYes: if (width == 0 and height == 0 and\\n         color == \\'red\\' and emphasis == \\'strong\\'):\\n\\n     (bridge_questions.clarification_on\\n      .average_airspeed_of.unladen_swallow) = \\'African or European?\\'\\n\\n     with (\\n         very_long_first_expression_function() as spam,\\n         very_long_second_expression_function() as beans,\\n         third_thing() as eggs,\\n     ):\\n       place_order(eggs, beans, spam, beans)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n\\nNo:  if width == 0 and height == 0 and \\\\\\n         color == \\'red\\' and emphasis == \\'strong\\':\\n\\n     bridge_questions.clarification_on \\\\\\n         .average_airspeed_of.unladen_swallow = \\'African or European?\\'\\n\\n     with very_long_first_expression_function() as spam, \\\\\\n           very_long_second_expression_function() as beans, \\\\\\n           third_thing() as eggs:\\n       place_order(eggs, beans, spam, beans)\\n```\\n\\nWhen a literal string won\\'t fit on a single line, use parentheses for implicit\\nline joining.\\n\\n```python\\nx = (\\'This will build a very long long \\'\\n     \\'long long long long long long string\\')\\n```\\n\\nPrefer to break lines at the highest possible syntactic level. If you must break\\na line twice, break it at the same syntactic level both times.\\n\\n```python\\nYes: bridgekeeper.answer(\\n         name=\"Arthur\", quest=questlib.find(owner=\"Arthur\", perilous=True))\\n\\n     answer = (a_long_line().of_chained_methods()\\n               .that_eventually_provides().an_answer())\\n\\n     if (\\n         config is None\\n         or \\'editor.language\\' not in config\\n         or config[\\'editor.language\\'].use_spaces is False\\n     ):\\n       use_tabs()\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo: bridgekeeper.answer(name=\"Arthur\", quest=questlib.find(\\n        owner=\"Arthur\", perilous=True))\\n\\n    answer = a_long_line().of_chained_methods().that_eventually_provides(\\n        ).an_answer()\\n\\n    if (config is None or \\'editor.language\\' not in config or config[\\n        \\'editor.language\\'].use_spaces is False):\\n      use_tabs()\\n\\n```\\n\\nWithin comments, put long URLs on their own line if necessary.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:  # See details at\\n      # http://www.example.com/us/developer/documentation/api/content/v2.0/csv_file_name_extension_full_specification.html\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:  # See details at\\n     # http://www.example.com/us/developer/documentation/api/content/\\\\\\n     # v2.0/csv_file_name_extension_full_specification.html\\n```\\n\\nMake note of the indentation of the elements in the line continuation examples\\nabove; see the [indentation](#s3.4-indentation) section for explanation.\\n\\n[Docstring](#docstrings) summary lines must remain within the 80 character\\nlimit.\\n\\nIn all other cases where a line exceeds 80 characters, and the\\n[Black](https://github.com/psf/black) or [Pyink](https://github.com/google/pyink)\\nauto-formatter does not help bring the line below the limit, the line is allowed\\nto exceed this maximum. Authors are encouraged to manually break the line up per\\nthe notes above when it is sensible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.3 Parentheses \\n\\nUse parentheses sparingly.\\n\\nIt is fine, though not required, to use parentheses around tuples. Do not use\\nthem in return statements or conditional statements unless using parentheses for\\nimplied line continuation or to indicate a tuple.\\n\\n```python\\nYes: if foo:\\n         bar()\\n     while x:\\n         x = bar()\\n     if x and y:\\n         bar()\\n     if not x:\\n         bar()\\n     # For a 1 item tuple the ()s are more visually obvious than the comma.\\n     onesie = (foo,)\\n     return foo\\n     return spam, beans\\n     return (spam, beans)\\n     for (x, y) in dict.items(): ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:  if (x):\\n         bar()\\n     if not(x):\\n         bar()\\n     return (foo)\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.4 Indentation \\n\\nIndent your code blocks with *4 spaces*.\\n\\nNever use tabs. Implied line continuation should align wrapped elements\\nvertically (see [line length examples](#s3.2-line-length)), or use a hanging\\n4-space indent. Closing (round, square or curly) brackets can be placed at the\\nend of the expression, or on separate lines, but then should be indented the\\nsame as the line with the corresponding opening bracket.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:   # Aligned with opening delimiter.\\n       foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,\\n                                var_three, var_four)\\n       meal = (spam,\\n               beans)\\n\\n       # Aligned with opening delimiter in a dictionary.\\n       foo = {\\n           \\'long_dictionary_key\\': value1 +\\n                                  value2,\\n           ...\\n       }\\n\\n       # 4-space hanging indent; nothing on first line.\\n       foo = long_function_name(\\n           var_one, var_two, var_three,\\n           var_four)\\n       meal = (\\n           spam,\\n           beans)\\n\\n       # 4-space hanging indent; nothing on first line,\\n       # closing parenthesis on a new line.\\n       foo = long_function_name(\\n           var_one, var_two, var_three,\\n           var_four\\n       )\\n       meal = (\\n           spam,\\n           beans,\\n       )\\n\\n       # 4-space hanging indent in a dictionary.\\n       foo = {\\n           \\'long_dictionary_key\\':\\n               long_dictionary_value,\\n           ...\\n       }\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:    # Stuff on first line forbidden.\\n       foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,\\n           var_three, var_four)\\n       meal = (spam,\\n           beans)\\n\\n       # 2-space hanging indent forbidden.\\n       foo = long_function_name(\\n         var_one, var_two, var_three,\\n         var_four)\\n\\n       # No hanging indent in a dictionary.\\n       foo = {\\n           \\'long_dictionary_key\\':\\n           long_dictionary_value,\\n           ...\\n       }\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.4.1 Trailing commas in sequences of items? \\n\\nTrailing commas in sequences of items are recommended only when the closing\\ncontainer token `]`, `)`, or `}` does not appear on the same line as the final\\nelement, as well as for tuples with a single element. The presence of a trailing\\ncomma is also used as a hint to our Python code auto-formatter\\n[Black](https://github.com/psf/black) or [Pyink](https://github.com/google/pyink)\\nto direct it to auto-format the container of items to one item per line when the\\n`,` after the final element is present.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:   golomb3 = [0, 1, 3]\\n       golomb4 = [\\n           0,\\n           1,\\n           4,\\n           6,\\n       ]\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:    golomb4 = [\\n           0,\\n           1,\\n           4,\\n           6,]\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.5 Blank Lines \\n\\nTwo blank lines between top-level definitions, be they function or class\\ndefinitions. One blank line between method definitions and between the docstring\\nof a `class` and the first method. No blank line following a `def` line. Use\\nsingle blank lines as you judge appropriate within functions or methods.\\n\\nBlank lines need not be anchored to the definition. For example, related\\ncomments immediately preceding function, class, and method definitions can make\\nsense.

Start the main file of a\\nprogram with\\n`#!/usr/bin/env python3` (to support virtualenvs) or `#!/usr/bin/python3` per\\n[PEP-394](https://peps.python.org/pep-0394/).\\n\\nThis line is used by the kernel to find the Python interpreter, but is ignored by Python when importing modules. It is only necessary on a file intended to be executed directly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.8 Comments and Docstrings \\n\\nBe sure to use the right style for module, function, method docstrings and\\ninline comments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.8.1 Docstrings \\n\\nPython uses *docstrings* to document code. A docstring is a string that is the\\nfirst statement in a package, module, class or function. These strings can be\\nextracted automatically through the `__doc__` member of the object and are used\\nby `pydoc`.\\n(Try running `pydoc` on your module to see how it looks.) Always use the\\nthree-double-quote `\"\"\"` format for docstrings (per\\n[PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)). A docstring should be organized\\nas a summary line (one physical line not exceeding 80 characters) terminated by\\na period, question mark, or exclamation point. When writing more (encouraged),\\nthis must be followed by a blank line, followed by the rest of the docstring\\nstarting at the same cursor position as the first quote of the first line. There\\nare more formatting guidelines for docstrings below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.8.2 Modules \\n\\nEvery file should contain license boilerplate. Choose the appropriate boilerplate for the license used by the project (for example, Apache 2.0, BSD, LGPL, GPL).\\n\\nFiles should start with a docstring describing the contents and usage of the\\nmodule.\\n```python\\n\"\"\"A one-line summary of the module or program, terminated by a period.\\n\\nLeave one blank line.  The rest of this docstring should contain an\\noverall description of the module or program.  Optionally, it may also\\ncontain a brief description of exported classes and functions and/or usage\\nexamples.\\n\\nTypical usage example:\\n\\n  foo = ClassFoo()\\n  bar = foo.function_bar()\\n\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n##### 3.8.2.1 Test modules \\n\\nModule-level docstrings for test files are not required. They should be included\\nonly when there is additional information that can be provided.\\n\\nExamples include some specifics on how the test should be run, an explanation of\\nan unusual setup pattern, dependency on the external environment, and so on.\\n\\n```python\\n\"\"\"This blaze test uses golden files.\\n\\nYou can update those files by running\\n`blaze run //foo/bar:foo_test -- --update_golden_files` from the `google3`\\ndirectory.\\n\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\nDocstrings that do not provide any new information should not be used.\\n\\n```python\\n\"\"\"Tests for foo.bar.\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.8.3 Functions and Methods \\n\\nIn this section, \"function\" means a method, function, generator, or property.\\n\\nA docstring is mandatory for every function that has one or more of the\\nfollowing properties:\\n\\n-   being part of the public API\\n-   nontrivial size\\n-   non-obvious logic\\n\\nA docstring should give enough information to write a call to the function\\nwithout reading the function\\'s code. The docstring should describe the\\nfunction\\'s calling syntax and its semantics, but generally not its\\nimplementation details, unless those details are relevant to how the function is\\nto be used. For example, a function that mutates one of its arguments as a side\\neffect should note that in its docstring. Otherwise, subtle but important\\ndetails of a function\\'s implementation that are not relevant to the caller are\\nbetter expressed as comments alongside the code than within the function\\'s\\ndocstring.\\n\\nThe docstring may be descriptive-style (`\"\"\"Fetches rows from a Bigtable.\"\"\"`)\\nor imperative-style (`\"\"\"Fetch rows from a Bigtable.\"\"\"`), but the style should\\nbe consistent within a file. The docstring for a `@property` data descriptor\\nshould use the same style as the docstring for an attribute or a\\nfunction argument (`\"\"\"The Bigtable path.\"\"\"`,\\nrather than `\"\"\"Returns the Bigtable path.\"\"\"`).\\n\\nCertain aspects of a function should be documented in special sections, listed\\nbelow. Each section begins with a heading line, which ends with a colon. All\\nsections other than the heading should maintain a hanging indent of two or four\\nspaces (be consistent within a file). These sections can be omitted in cases\\nwhere the function\\'s name and signature are informative enough that it can be\\naptly described using a one-line docstring.\\n\\n\\n[*Args:*](#doc-function-args)\\n:   List each parameter by name. A description should follow the name, and be\\n    separated by a colon followed by either a space or newline. If the\\n    description is too long to fit on a single 80-character line, use a hanging\\n    indent of 2 or 4 spaces more than the parameter name (be consistent with the\\n    rest of the docstrings in the file). The description should include required\\n    type(s) if the code does not contain a corresponding type annotation. If a\\n    function accepts `*foo` (variable length argument lists) and/or `**bar`\\n    (arbitrary keyword arguments), they should be listed as `*foo` and `**bar`.\\n\\n\\n[*Returns:* (or *Yields:* for generators)](#doc-function-returns)\\n:   Describe the semantics of the return value, including any type information\\n    that the type annotation does not provide. If the function only returns\\n    None, this section is not required. It may also be omitted if the docstring\\n    starts with \"Return\", \"Returns\", \"Yield\", or \"Yields\" (e.g. `\"\"\"Returns row\\n    from Bigtable as a tuple of strings.\"\"\"`) *and* the opening sentence is\\n    sufficient to describe the return value. Do not imitate older \\'NumPy style\\'\\n    ([example](https://numpy.org/doc/1.24/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.qr.html)),\\n    which frequently documented a tuple return value as if it were multiple\\n    return values with individual names (never mentioning the tuple). Instead,\\n    describe such a return value as: \"Returns: A tuple (mat_a, mat_b), where\\n    mat_a is ..., and ...\". The auxiliary names in the docstring need not\\n    necessarily correspond to any internal names used in the function body (as\\n    those are not part of the API). If the function uses `yield` (is a\\n    generator), the `Yields:` section should document the object returned by\\n    `next()`, instead of the generator object itself that the call evaluates to.\\n\\n\\n[*Raises:*](#doc-function-raises)\\n:   List all exceptions that are relevant to the interface followed by a\\n    description. Use a similar exception name + colon + space or newline and\\n    hanging indent style as described in *Args:*. You should not document\\n    exceptions that get raised if the API specified in the docstring is violated\\n    (because this would paradoxically make behavior under violation of the API\\n    part of the API).\\n\\n```python\\ndef fetch_smalltable_rows(\\n    table_handle: smalltable.Table,\\n    keys: Sequence[bytes | str],\\n    require_all_keys: bool = False,\\n) -> Mapping[bytes, tuple[str, ...]]:\\n    \"\"\"Fetches rows from a Smalltable.\\n\\n    Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance\\n    represented by table_handle.

This implies that subclasses of `Exception`\\nshould also describe what the exception represents, and not the context in which\\nit might occur. The class docstring should not repeat unnecessary information,\\nsuch as that the class is a class.\\n\\n```python\\n# Yes:\\nclass CheeseShopAddress:\\n  \"\"\"The address of a cheese shop.\\n\\n  ...\\n  \"\"\"\\n\\nclass OutOfCheeseError(Exception):\\n  \"\"\"No more cheese is available.\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n# No:\\nclass CheeseShopAddress:\\n  \"\"\"Class that describes the address of a cheese shop.\\n\\n  ...\\n  \"\"\"\\n\\nclass OutOfCheeseError(Exception):\\n  \"\"\"Raised when no more cheese is available.\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.8.5 Block and Inline Comments \\n\\nThe final place to have comments is in tricky parts of the code. If you\\'re going\\nto have to explain it at the next [code review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review),\\nyou should comment it now. Complicated operations get a few lines of comments\\nbefore the operations commence. Non-obvious ones get comments at the end of the\\nline.\\n\\n```python\\n# We use a weighted dictionary search to find out where i is in\\n# the array.  We extrapolate position based on the largest num\\n# in the array and the array size and then do binary search to\\n# get the exact number.\\n\\nif i & (i-1) == 0:  # True if i is 0 or a power of 2.\\n```\\n\\nTo improve legibility, these comments should start at least 2 spaces away from\\nthe code with the comment character `#`, followed by at least one space before\\nthe text of the comment itself.\\n\\nOn the other hand, never describe the code. Assume the person reading the code\\nknows Python (though not what you\\'re trying to do) better than you do.\\n\\n```python\\n# BAD COMMENT: Now go through the b array and make sure whenever i occurs\\n# the next element is i+1\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.8.6 Punctuation, Spelling, and Grammar \\n\\nPay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar; it is easier to read\\nwell-written comments than badly written ones.\\n\\nComments should be as readable as narrative text, with proper capitalization and\\npunctuation. In many cases, complete sentences are more readable than sentence\\nfragments. Shorter comments, such as comments at the end of a line of code, can\\nsometimes be less formal, but you should be consistent with your style.\\n\\nAlthough it can be frustrating to have a code reviewer point out that you are\\nusing a comma when you should be using a semicolon, it is very important that\\nsource code maintain a high level of clarity and readability. Proper\\npunctuation, spelling, and grammar help with that goal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.10 Strings \\n\\nUse an\\n[f-string](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings),\\nthe `%` operator, or the `format` method for formatting strings, even when the\\nparameters are all strings. Use your best judgment to decide between string\\nformatting options. A single join with `+` is okay but do not format with `+`.\\n\\n```python\\nYes: x = f\\'name: {name}; score: {n}\\'\\n     x = \\'%s, %s!\\' % (imperative, expletive)\\n     x = \\'{}, {}\\'.format(first, second)\\n     x = \\'name: %s; score: %d\\' % (name, n)\\n     x = \\'name: %(name)s; score: %(score)d\\' % {\\'name\\':name, \\'score\\':n}\\n     x = \\'name: {}; score: {}\\'.format(name, n)\\n     x = a + b\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo: x = first + \\', \\' + second\\n    x = \\'name: \\' + name + \\'; score: \\' + str(n)\\n```\\n\\nAvoid using the `+` and `+=` operators to accumulate a string within a loop. In\\nsome conditions, accumulating a string with addition can lead to quadratic\\nrather than linear running time. Although common accumulations of this sort may\\nbe optimized on CPython, that is an implementation detail. The conditions under\\nwhich an optimization applies are not easy to predict and may change. Instead,\\nadd each substring to a list and `\\'\\'.join` the list after the loop terminates,\\nor write each substring to an `io.StringIO` buffer. These techniques\\nconsistently have amortized-linear run-time complexity.\\n\\n```python\\nYes: items = [\\'\\']\\n     for last_name, first_name in employee_list:\\n         items.append(\\'%s, %s\\' % (last_name, first_name))\\n     items.append(\\'\\')\\n     employee_table = \\'\\'.join(items)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo: employee_table = \\'\\'\\n    for last_name, first_name in employee_list:\\n        employee_table += \\'%s, %s\\' % (last_name, first_name)\\n    employee_table += \\'\\'\\n```\\n\\nBe consistent with your choice of string quote character within a file. Pick `\\'`\\nor `\"` and stick with it. It is okay to use the other quote character on a\\nstring to avoid the need to backslash-escape quote characters within the string.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\n  Python(\\'Why are you hiding your eyes?\\')\\n  Gollum(\"I\\'m scared of lint errors.\")\\n  Narrator(\\'\"Good!\" thought a happy Python reviewer.\\')\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\n  Python(\"Why are you hiding your eyes?\")\\n  Gollum(\\'The lint. It burns. It burns us.\\')\\n  Gollum(\"Always the great lint. Watching. Watching.\")\\n```\\n\\nPrefer `\"\"\"` for multi-line strings rather than `\\'\\'\\'`. Projects may choose to\\nuse `\\'\\'\\'` for all non-docstring multi-line strings if and only if they also use\\n`\\'` for regular strings. Docstrings must use `\"\"\"` regardless.\\n\\nMulti-line strings do not flow with the indentation of the rest of the program.\\nIf you need to avoid embedding extra space in the string, use either\\nconcatenated single-line strings or a multi-line string with\\n[`textwrap.dedent()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html#textwrap.dedent)\\nto remove the initial space on each line:\\n\\n```python\\n  No:\\n  long_string = \"\"\"This is pretty ugly.\\nDon\\'t do this.\\n\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n  Yes:\\n  long_string = \"\"\"This is fine if your use case can accept\\n      extraneous leading spaces.\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n  Yes:\\n  long_string = (\"And this is fine if you cannot accept\\\\n\" +\\n                 \"extraneous leading spaces.\")\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n  Yes:\\n  long_string = (\"And this too is fine if you cannot accept\\\\n\"\\n                 \"extraneous leading spaces.\")\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n  Yes:\\n  import textwrap\\n\\n  long_string = textwrap.dedent(\"\"\"\\\\\\n      This is also fine, because textwrap.dedent()\\n      will collapse common leading spaces in each line.\"\"\")\\n```\\n\\nNote that using a backslash here does not violate the prohibition against\\n[explicit line continuation](#line-length); in this case, the backslash is\\n[escaping a newline](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals)\\nin a string literal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.10.1 Logging \\n\\nFor logging functions that expect a pattern-string (with %-placeholders) as\\ntheir first argument: Always call them with a string literal (not an f-string!)\\nas their first argument with pattern-parameters as subsequent arguments. Some\\nlogging implementations collect the unexpanded pattern-string as a queryable\\nfield. It also prevents spending time rendering a message that no logger is\\nconfigured to output.\\n\\n```python\\n  Yes:\\n  import tensorflow as tf\\n  logger = tf.get_logger()\\n  logger.info(\\'TensorFlow Version is: %s\\', tf.__version__)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n  Yes:\\n  import os\\n  from absl import logging\\n\\n  logging.info(\\'Current $PAGER is: %s\\', os.getenv(\\'PAGER\\', default=\\'\\'))\\n\\n  homedir = os.getenv(\\'HOME\\')\\n  if homedir is None or not os.access(homedir, os.W_OK):\\n    logging.error(\\'Cannot write to home directory, $HOME=%r\\', homedir)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n  No:\\n  import os\\n  from absl import logging\\n\\n  logging.info(\\'Current $PAGER is:\\')\\n  logging.info(os.getenv(\\'PAGER\\', default=\\'\\'))\\n\\n  homedir = os.getenv(\\'HOME\\')\\n  if homedir is None or not os.access(homedir, os.W_OK):\\n    logging.error(f\\'Cannot write to home directory, $HOME={homedir!r}\\')\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.10.2 Error Messages \\n\\nError messages (such as: message strings on exceptions like `ValueError`, or\\nmessages shown to the user) should follow three guidelines:\\n\\n1.  The message needs to precisely match the actual error condition.\\n\\n2.  Interpolated pieces need to always be clearly identifiable as such.\\n\\n3.  They should allow simple automated processing (e.g. grepping).\\n\\n```python\\n  Yes:\\n  if not 0 <= p <= 1:\\n    raise ValueError(f\\'Not a probability: {p=}\\')\\n\\n  try:\\n    os.rmdir(workdir)\\n  except OSError as error:\\n    logging.warning(\\'Could not remove directory (reason: %r): %r\\',\\n                    error, workdir)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n  No:\\n  if p < 0 or p > 1:  # PROBLEM: also false for float(\\'nan\\')!\\n    raise ValueError(f\\'Not a probability: {p=}\\')\\n\\n  try:\\n    os.rmdir(workdir)\\n  except OSError:\\n    # PROBLEM: Message makes an assumption that might not be true:\\n    # Deletion might have failed for some other reason, misleading\\n    # whoever has to debug this.\\n    logging.warning(\\'Directory already was deleted: %s\\', workdir)\\n\\n  try:\\n    os.rmdir(workdir)\\n  except OSError:\\n    # PROBLEM: The message is harder to grep for than necessary, and\\n    # not universally non-confusing for all possible values of `workdir`.\\n    # Imagine someone calling a library function with such code\\n    # using a name such as workdir = \\'deleted\\'. The warning would read:\\n    # \"The deleted directory could not be deleted.\"\\n    logging.warning(\\'The %s directory could not be deleted.\\', workdir)\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.11 Files, Sockets, and similar Stateful Resources \\n\\nExplicitly close files and sockets when done with them. This rule naturally\\nextends to closeable resources that internally use sockets, such as database\\nconnections, and also other resources that need to be closed down in a similar\\nfashion. To name only a few examples, this also includes\\n[mmap](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html) mappings,\\n[h5py File objects](https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/high/file.html), and\\n[matplotlib.pyplot figure windows](https://matplotlib.org/2.1.0/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.close.html).\\n\\nLeaving files, sockets or other such stateful objects open unnecessarily has\\nmany downsides:\\n\\n-   They may consume limited system resources, such as file descriptors. Code\\n    that deals with many such objects may exhaust those resources unnecessarily\\n    if they\\'re not returned to the system promptly after use.\\n-   Holding files open may prevent other actions such as moving or deleting\\n    them, or unmounting a filesystem.\\n-   Files and sockets that are shared throughout a program may inadvertently be\\n    read from or written to after logically being closed. If they are actually\\n    closed, attempts to read or write from them will raise exceptions, making\\n    the problem known sooner.\\n\\nFurthermore, while files and sockets (and some similarly behaving resources) are\\nautomatically closed when the object is destructed, coupling the lifetime of the\\nobject to the state of the resource is poor practice:\\n\\n-   There are no guarantees as to when the runtime will actually invoke the\\n    `__del__` method. Different Python implementations use different memory\\n    management techniques, such as delayed garbage collection, which may\\n    increase the object\\'s lifetime arbitrarily and indefinitely.\\n-   Unexpected references to the file, e.g. in globals or exception tracebacks,\\n    may keep it around longer than intended.\\n\\nRelying on finalizers to do automatic cleanup that has observable side effects\\nhas been rediscovered over and over again to lead to major problems, across many\\ndecades and multiple languages (see e.g.\\n[this article](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/MET12-J.+Do+not+use+finalizers)\\nfor Java).\\n\\nThe preferred way to manage files and similar resources is using the\\n[`with` statement](http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement):\\n\\n```python\\nwith open(\"hello.txt\") as hello_file:\\n    for line in hello_file:\\n        print(line)\\n```\\n\\nFor file-like objects that do not support the `with` statement, use\\n`contextlib.closing()`:\\n\\n```python\\nimport contextlib\\n\\nwith contextlib.closing(urllib.urlopen(\"http://www.python.org/\")) as front_page:\\n    for line in front_page:\\n        print(line)\\n```\\n\\nIn rare cases where context-based resource management is infeasible, code\\ndocumentation must explain clearly how resource lifetime is managed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.12 TODO Comments \\n\\nUse `TODO` comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or\\ngood-enough but not perfect.\\n\\nA `TODO` comment begins with the word `TODO` in all caps, a following colon, and\\na link to a resource that contains the context, ideally a bug reference. A bug\\nreference is preferable because bugs are tracked and have follow-up comments.\\nFollow this piece of context with an explanatory string introduced with a hyphen\\n`-`. \\nThe purpose is to have a consistent `TODO` format that can be searched to find\\nout how to get more details. \\n\\n```python\\n# TODO: crbug.com/192795 - Investigate cpufreq optimizations.\\n```\\n\\nOld style, formerly recommended, but discouraged for use in new code:\\n\\n\\n```python\\n# TODO(crbug.com/192795): Investigate cpufreq optimizations.\\n# TODO(yourusername): Use a \"\\\\*\" here for concatenation operator.\\n```\\n\\nAvoid adding TODOs that refer to an individual or team as the context:\\n\\n```python\\n# TODO: @yourusername - File an issue and use a \\'*\\' for repetition.\\n```\\n\\nIf your `TODO` is of the form \"At a future date do something\" make sure that you\\neither include a very specific date (\"Fix by November 2009\") or a very specific\\nevent (\"Remove this code when all clients can handle XML responses.\") that\\nfuture code maintainers will comprehend. Issues are ideal for tracking this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.13 Imports formatting \\n\\nImports should be on separate lines; there are\\n[exceptions for `typing` and `collections.abc` imports](#typing-imports).\\n\\nE.g.:\\n\\n```python\\nYes: from collections.abc import Mapping, Sequence\\n     import os\\n     import sys\\n     from typing import Any, NewType\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:  import os, sys\\n```\\n\\n\\nImports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments\\nand docstrings and before module globals and constants. Imports should be\\ngrouped from most generic to least generic:\\n\\n1.  Python future import statements. For example:\\n\\n    ```python\\n    from __future__ import annotations\\n    ```\\n\\n    See [above](#from-future-imports) for more information about those.\\n\\n2.  Python standard library imports. For example:\\n\\n    ```python\\n    import sys\\n    ```\\n\\n3.  [third-party](https://pypi.org/) module\\n    or package imports. For example:\\n\\n    \\n    ```python\\n    import tensorflow as tf\\n    ```\\n\\n4.  Code repository\\n    sub-package imports. For example:\\n\\n    \\n    ```python\\n    from otherproject.ai import mind\\n    ```\\n\\n5.  **Deprecated:** application-specific imports that are part of the same\\n    top-level\\n    sub-package as this file. For example:\\n\\n    \\n    ```python\\n    from myproject.backend.hgwells import time_machine\\n    ```\\n\\n    You may find older Google Python Style code doing this, but it is no longer\\n    required. **New code is encouraged not to bother with this.** Simply treat\\n    application-specific sub-package imports the same as other sub-package\\n    imports.\\n\\n    \\nWithin each grouping, imports should be sorted lexicographically, ignoring case,\\naccording to each module\\'s full package path (the `path` in `from path import\\n...`). Code may optionally place a blank line between import sections.\\n\\n```python\\nimport collections\\nimport queue\\nimport sys\\n\\nfrom absl import app\\nfrom absl import flags\\nimport bs4\\nimport cryptography\\nimport tensorflow as tf\\n\\nfrom book.genres import scifi\\nfrom myproject.backend import huxley\\nfrom myproject.backend.hgwells import time_machine\\nfrom myproject.backend.state_machine import main_loop\\nfrom otherproject.ai import body\\nfrom otherproject.ai import mind\\nfrom otherproject.ai import soul\\n\\n# Older style code may have these imports down here instead:\\n#from myproject.backend.hgwells import time_machine\\n#from myproject.backend.state_machine import main_loop\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.14 Statements \\n\\nGenerally only one statement per line.\\n\\nHowever, you may put the result of a test on the same line as the test only if\\nthe entire statement fits on one line. In particular, you can never do so with\\n`try`/`except` since the `try` and `except` can\\'t both fit on the same line, and\\nyou can only do so with an `if` if there is no `else`.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\n\\n  if foo: bar(foo)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\n\\n  if foo: bar(foo)\\n  else:   baz(foo)\\n\\n  try:               bar(foo)\\n  except ValueError: baz(foo)\\n\\n  try:\\n      bar(foo)\\n  except ValueError: baz(foo)\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.15 Getters and Setters \\n\\nGetter and setter functions (also called accessors and mutators) should be used\\nwhen they provide a meaningful role or behavior for getting or setting a\\nvariable\\'s value.\\n\\nIn particular, they should be used when getting or setting the variable is\\ncomplex or the cost is significant, either currently or in a reasonable future.\\n\\nIf, for example, a pair of getters/setters simply read and write an internal\\nattribute, the internal attribute should be made public instead. By comparison,\\nif setting a variable means some state is invalidated or rebuilt, it should be a\\nsetter function. The function invocation hints that a potentially non-trivial\\noperation is occurring. Alternatively, [properties](#properties) may be an\\noption when simple logic is needed, or refactoring to no longer need getters and\\nsetters.\\n\\nGetters and setters should follow the [Naming](#s3.16-naming) guidelines, such\\nas `get_foo()` and `set_foo()`.\\n\\nIf the past behavior allowed access through a property, do not bind the new\\ngetter/setter functions to the property. Any code still attempting to access the\\nvariable by the old method should break visibly so they are made aware of the\\nchange in complexity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.16 Naming \\n\\n`module_name`, `package_name`, `ClassName`, `method_name`, `ExceptionName`,\\n`function_name`, `GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME`, `global_var_name`, `instance_var_name`,\\n`function_parameter_name`, `local_var_name`, `query_proper_noun_for_thing`,\\n`send_acronym_via_https`.\\n\\n\\nNames should be descriptive. This includes functions, classes, variables,\\nattributes, files and any other type of named entities.\\n\\nAvoid abbreviation. In particular, do not use abbreviations that are ambiguous\\nor unfamiliar to readers outside your project, and do not abbreviate by deleting\\nletters within a word.\\n\\nAlways use a `.py` filename extension. Never use dashes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.16.1 Names to Avoid \\n\\n-   single character names, except for specifically allowed cases:\\n\\n    -   counters or iterators (e.g. `i`, `j`, `k`, `v`, et al.)\\n    -   `e` as an exception identifier in `try/except` statements.\\n    -   `f` as a file handle in `with` statements\\n    -   private [type variables](#typing-type-var) with no constraints (e.g.\\n        `_T = TypeVar(\"_T\")`, `_P = ParamSpec(\"_P\")`)\\n    -   names that match established notation in a reference paper or algorithm\\n        (see [Mathematical Notation](#math-notation))\\n\\n    Please be mindful not to abuse single-character naming. Generally speaking,\\n    descriptiveness should be proportional to the name\\'s scope of visibility.\\n    For example, `i` might be a fine name for 5-line code block but within\\n    multiple nested scopes, it is likely too vague.\\n\\n-   dashes (`-`) in any package/module name\\n\\n-   `__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__` names (reserved by Python)\\n\\n-   offensive terms\\n\\n-   names that needlessly include the type of the variable (for example:\\n    `id_to_name_dict`)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.16.2 Naming Conventions \\n\\n-   \"Internal\" means internal to a module, or protected or private within a\\n    class.\\n\\n-   Prepending a single underscore (`_`) has some support for protecting module\\n    variables and functions (linters will flag protected member access). Note\\n    that it is okay for unit tests to access protected constants from the\\n    modules under test.\\n\\n-   Prepending a double underscore (`__` aka \"dunder\") to an instance variable\\n    or method effectively makes the variable or method private to its class\\n    (using name mangling); we discourage its use as it impacts readability and\\n    testability, and isn\\'t *really* private. Prefer a single underscore.\\n\\n-   Place related classes and top-level functions together in a\\n    module.\\n    Unlike Java, there is no need to limit yourself to one class per module.\\n\\n-   Use CapWords for class names, but lower\\\\_with\\\\_under.py for module names.\\n    Although there are some old modules named CapWords.py, this is now\\n    discouraged because it\\'s confusing when the module happens to be named after\\n    a class. (\"wait -- did I write `import StringIO` or `from StringIO import\\n    StringIO`?\")\\n\\n-   New *unit test* files follow PEP 8 compliant lower\\\\_with\\\\_under method\\n    names, for example, `test__`. For consistency(\\\\*)\\n    with legacy modules that follow CapWords function names, underscores may\\n    appear in method names starting with `test` to separate logical components\\n    of the name. One possible pattern is `test_`.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.16.3 File Naming \\n\\nPython filenames must have a `.py` extension and must not contain dashes (`-`).\\nThis allows them to be imported and unittested. If you want an executable to be\\naccessible without the extension, use a symbolic link or a simple bash wrapper\\ncontaining `exec \"$0.py\" \"$@\"`.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.16.4 Guidelines derived from [Guido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum)\\'s Recommendations \\n\\n\\n\\nType\\nPublic\\nInternal\\n\\n\\nPackages\\nlower_with_under\\n\\n\\n\\nModules\\nlower_with_under\\n_lower_with_under\\n\\n\\nClasses\\nCapWords\\n_CapWords\\n\\n\\nExceptions\\nCapWords\\n\\n\\n\\nFunctions\\nlower_with_under()\\n_lower_with_under()\\n\\n\\nGlobal/Class Constants\\nCAPS_WITH_UNDER\\n_CAPS_WITH_UNDER\\n\\n\\nGlobal/Class Variables\\nlower_with_under\\n_lower_with_under\\n\\n\\nInstance Variables\\nlower_with_under\\n_lower_with_under (protected)\\n\\n\\nMethod Names\\nlower_with_under()\\n_lower_with_under() (protected)\\n\\n\\nFunction/Method Parameters\\nlower_with_under\\n\\n\\n\\nLocal Variables\\nlower_with_under\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.16.5 Mathematical Notation \\n\\nFor mathematically-heavy code, short variable names that would otherwise violate\\nthe style guide are preferred when they match established notation in a\\nreference paper or algorithm.\\n\\nWhen using names based on established notation:\\n\\n1.  Cite the source of all naming conventions, preferably with a hyperlink to\\n    academic resource itself, in a comment or docstring. If the source is not\\n    accessible, clearly document the naming conventions.\\n2.  Prefer PEP8-compliant `descriptive_names` for public APIs, which are much\\n    more likely to be encountered out of context.\\n3.  Use a narrowly-scoped `pylint: disable=invalid-name` directive to silence\\n    warnings. For just a few variables, use the directive as an endline comment\\n    for each one; for more, apply the directive at the beginning of a block.\\n\\n\\n### 3.17 Main \\n\\nIn Python, `pydoc` as well as unit tests require modules to be importable. If a\\nfile is meant to be used as an executable, its main functionality should be in a\\n`main()` function, and your code should always check `if __name__ == \\'__main__\\'`\\nbefore executing your main program, so that it is not executed when the module\\nis imported.\\n\\nWhen using [absl](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py), use `app.run`:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom absl import app\\n...\\n\\ndef main(argv: Sequence[str]):\\n    # process non-flag arguments\\n    ...\\n\\nif __name__ == \\'__main__\\':\\n    app.run(main)\\n```\\n\\nOtherwise, use:\\n\\n```python\\ndef main():\\n    ...\\n\\nif __name__ == \\'__main__\\':\\n    main()\\n```\\n\\nAll code at the top level will be executed when the module is imported. Be\\ncareful not to call functions, create objects, or perform other operations that\\nshould not be executed when the file is being `pydoc`ed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.18 Function length \\n\\nPrefer small and focused functions.\\n\\nWe recognize that long functions are sometimes appropriate, so no hard limit is\\nplaced on function length. If a function exceeds about 40 lines, think about\\nwhether it can be broken up without harming the structure of the program.\\n\\nEven if your long function works perfectly now, someone modifying it in a few\\nmonths may add new behavior. This could result in bugs that are hard to find.\\nKeeping your functions short and simple makes it easier for other people to read\\nand modify your code.\\n\\nYou could find long and complicated functions when working with\\nsome\\ncode. Do not be intimidated by modifying existing code: if working with such a\\nfunction proves to be difficult, you find that errors are hard to debug, or you\\nwant to use a piece of it in several different contexts, consider breaking up\\nthe function into smaller and more manageable pieces.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### 3.19 Type Annotations \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.1 General Rules \\n\\n*   Familiarize yourself with\\n    [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).\\n\\n*   Annotating `self` or `cls` is generally not necessary.\\n    [`Self`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Self) can be\\n    used if it is necessary for proper type information, e.g.\\n\\n    ```python\\n    from typing import Self\\n\\n    class BaseClass:\\n      @classmethod\\n      def create(cls) -> Self:\\n        ...\\n\\n      def difference(self, other: Self) -> float:\\n        ...\\n    ```\\n\\n*   Similarly, don\\'t feel compelled to annotate the return value of `__init__`\\n    (where `None` is the only valid option).\\n\\n*   If any other variable or a returned type should not be expressed, use `Any`.\\n\\n*   You are not required to annotate all the functions in a module.\\n\\n    -   At least annotate your public APIs.\\n    -   Use judgment to get to a good balance between safety and clarity on the\\n        one hand, and flexibility on the other.\\n    -   Annotate code that is prone to type-related errors (previous bugs or\\n        complexity).\\n    -   Annotate code that is hard to understand.\\n    -   Annotate code as it becomes stable from a types perspective. In many\\n        cases, you can annotate all the functions in mature code without losing\\n        too much flexibility.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.2 Line Breaking \\n\\nTry to follow the existing [indentation](#indentation) rules.\\n\\nAfter annotating, many function signatures will become \"one parameter per line\".\\nTo ensure the return type is also given its own line, a comma can be placed\\nafter the last parameter.\\n\\n```python\\ndef my_method(\\n    self,\\n    first_var: int,\\n    second_var: Foo,\\n    third_var: Bar | None,\\n) -> int:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nAlways prefer breaking between variables, and not, for example, between variable\\nnames and type annotations. However, if everything fits on the same line, go for\\nit.\\n\\n```python\\ndef my_method(self, first_var: int) -> int:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nIf the combination of the function name, the last parameter, and the return type\\nis too long, indent by 4 in a new line. When using line breaks, prefer putting\\neach parameter and the return type on their own lines and aligning the closing\\nparenthesis with the `def`:\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\ndef my_method(\\n    self,\\n    other_arg: MyLongType | None,\\n) -> tuple[MyLongType1, MyLongType1]:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nOptionally, the return type may be put on the same line as the last parameter:\\n\\n```python\\nOkay:\\ndef my_method(\\n    self,\\n    first_var: int,\\n    second_var: int) -> dict[OtherLongType, MyLongType]:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n`pylint`\\nallows you to move the closing parenthesis to a new line and align with the\\nopening one, but this is less readable.\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\ndef my_method(self,\\n              other_arg: MyLongType | None,\\n             ) -> dict[OtherLongType, MyLongType]:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nAs in the examples above, prefer not to break types. However, sometimes they are\\ntoo long to be on a single line (try to keep sub-types unbroken).\\n\\n```python\\ndef my_method(\\n    self,\\n    first_var: tuple[list[MyLongType1],\\n                     list[MyLongType2]],\\n    second_var: list[dict[\\n        MyLongType3, MyLongType4]],\\n) -> None:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nIf a single name and type is too long, consider using an\\n[alias](#typing-aliases) for the type. The last resort is to break after the\\ncolon and indent by 4.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\ndef my_function(\\n    long_variable_name:\\n        long_module_name.LongTypeName,\\n) -> None:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\ndef my_function(\\n    long_variable_name: long_module_name.\\n        LongTypeName,\\n) -> None:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.3 Forward Declarations \\n\\nIf you need to use a class name (from the same module) that is not yet\\ndefined -- for example, if you need the class name inside the declaration of\\nthat class, or if you use a class that is defined later in the code -- either\\nuse `from __future__ import annotations` or use a string for the class name.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\nfrom __future__ import annotations\\n\\nclass MyClass:\\n  def __init__(self, stack: Sequence[MyClass], item: OtherClass) -> None:\\n\\nclass OtherClass:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\nclass MyClass:\\n  def __init__(self, stack: Sequence[\\'MyClass\\'], item: \\'OtherClass\\') -> None:\\n\\nclass OtherClass:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.4 Default Values \\n\\nAs per [PEP-008](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#other-recommendations), use\\nspaces around the `=` *only* for arguments that have both a type annotation and\\na default value.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\ndef func(a: int = 0) -> int:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\ndef func(a:int=0) -> int:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.5 NoneType \\n\\nIn the Python type system, `NoneType` is a \"first class\" type, and for typing\\npurposes, `None` is an alias for `NoneType`. If an argument can be `None`, it\\nhas to be declared! You can use `|` union type expressions (recommended in new\\nPython 3.10+ code), or the older `Optional` and `Union` syntaxes.\\n\\nUse explicit `X | None` instead of implicit. Earlier versions of type checkers\\nallowed `a: str = None` to be interpreted as `a: str | None = None`, but that is\\nno longer the preferred behavior.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\ndef modern_or_union(a: str | int | None, b: str | None = None) -> str:\\n  ...\\ndef union_optional(a: Union[str, int, None], b: Optional[str] = None) -> str:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\ndef nullable_union(a: Union[None, str]) -> str:\\n  ...\\ndef implicit_optional(a: str = None) -> str:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.6 Type Aliases \\n\\nYou can declare aliases of complex types. The name of an alias should be\\nCapWorded. If the alias is used only in this module, it should be \\\\_Private.\\n\\nNote that the `: TypeAlias` annotation is only supported in versions 3.10+.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import TypeAlias\\n\\n_LossAndGradient: TypeAlias = tuple[tf.Tensor, tf.Tensor]\\nComplexTFMap: TypeAlias = Mapping[str, _LossAndGradient]\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.7 Ignoring Types \\n\\nYou can disable type checking on a line with the special comment `# type:\\nignore`.\\n\\n`pytype` has a disable option for specific errors (similar to lint):\\n\\n```python\\n# pytype: disable=attribute-error\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.8 Typing Variables \\n\\n\\n[*Annotated Assignments*](#annotated-assignments)\\n:   If an internal variable has a type that is hard or impossible to infer,\\n    specify its type with an annotated assignment - use a colon and type between\\n    the variable name and value (the same as is done with function arguments\\n    that have a default value):\\n\\n    ```python\\n    a: Foo = SomeUndecoratedFunction()\\n    ```\\n\\n\\n[*Type Comments*](#type-comments)\\n:   Though you may see them remaining in the codebase (they were necessary\\n    before Python 3.6), do not add any more uses of a `# type: `\\n    comment on the end of the line:\\n\\n    ```python\\n    a = SomeUndecoratedFunction()  # type: Foo\\n    ```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.9 Tuples vs Lists \\n\\nTyped lists can only contain objects of a single type. Typed tuples can either\\nhave a single repeated type or a set number of elements with different types.\\nThe latter is commonly used as the return type from a function.\\n\\n```python\\na: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]\\nb: tuple[int, ...] = (1, 2, 3)\\nc: tuple[int, str, float] = (1, \"2\", 3.5)\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.10 Type variables \\n\\nThe Python type system has\\n[generics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#generics). A type\\nvariable, such as `TypeVar` and `ParamSpec`, is a common way to use them.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom collections.abc import Callable\\nfrom typing import ParamSpec, TypeVar\\n_P = ParamSpec(\"_P\")\\n_T = TypeVar(\"_T\")\\n...\\ndef next(l: list[_T]) -> _T:\\n  return l.pop()\\n\\ndef print_when_called(f: Callable[_P, _T]) -> Callable[_P, _T]:\\n  def inner(*args: _P.args, **kwargs: _P.kwargs) -> _T:\\n    print(\"Function was called\")\\n    return f(*args, **kwargs)\\n  return inner\\n```\\n\\nA `TypeVar` can be constrained:\\n\\n```python\\nAddableType = TypeVar(\"AddableType\", int, float, str)\\ndef add(a: AddableType, b: AddableType) -> AddableType:\\n  return a + b\\n```\\n\\nA common predefined type variable in the `typing` module is `AnyStr`. Use it for\\nmultiple annotations that can be `bytes` or `str` and must all be the same type.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import AnyStr\\ndef check_length(x: AnyStr) -> AnyStr:\\n  if len(x) <= 42:\\n    return x\\n  raise ValueError()\\n```\\n\\nA type variable must have a descriptive name, unless it meets all of the\\nfollowing criteria:\\n\\n*   not externally visible\\n*   not constrained\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\n  _T = TypeVar(\"_T\")\\n  _P = ParamSpec(\"_P\")\\n  AddableType = TypeVar(\"AddableType\", int, float, str)\\n  AnyFunction = TypeVar(\"AnyFunction\", bound=Callable)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\n  T = TypeVar(\"T\")\\n  P = ParamSpec(\"P\")\\n  _T = TypeVar(\"_T\", int, float, str)\\n  _F = TypeVar(\"_F\", bound=Callable)\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.11 String types \\n\\n> Do not use `typing.Text` in new code. It\\'s only for Python 2/3 compatibility.\\n\\nUse `str` for string/text data. For code that deals with binary data, use\\n`bytes`.\\n\\n```python\\ndef deals_with_text_data(x: str) -> str:\\n  ...\\ndef deals_with_binary_data(x: bytes) -> bytes:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nIf all the string types of a function are always the same, for example if the\\nreturn type is the same as the argument type in the code above, use\\n[AnyStr](#typing-type-var).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.12 Imports For Typing \\n\\nFor symbols (including types, functions, and constants) from the `typing` or\\n`collections.abc` modules used to support static analysis and type checking,\\nalways import the symbol itself. This keeps common annotations more concise and\\nmatches typing practices used around the world. You are explicitly allowed to\\nimport multiple specific symbols on one line from the `typing` and\\n`collections.abc` modules. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom collections.abc import Mapping, Sequence\\nfrom typing import Any, Generic, cast, TYPE_CHECKING\\n```\\n\\nGiven that this way of importing adds items to the local namespace, names in\\n`typing` or `collections.abc` should be treated similarly to keywords, and not\\nbe defined in your Python code, typed or not. If there is a collision between a\\ntype and an existing name in a module, import it using `import x as y`.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Any as AnyType\\n```\\n\\nWhen annotating function signatures, prefer abstract container types like\\n`collections.abc.Sequence` over concrete types like `list`. If you need to use a\\nconcrete type (for example, a `tuple` of typed elements), prefer built-in types\\nlike `tuple` over the parametric type aliases from the `typing` module (e.g.,\\n`typing.Tuple`).\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\\n\\ndef transform_coordinates(original: List[Tuple[float, float]]) ->\\n    List[Tuple[float, float]]:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nfrom collections.abc import Sequence\\n\\ndef transform_coordinates(original: Sequence[tuple[float, float]]) ->\\n    Sequence[tuple[float, float]]:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.13 Conditional Imports \\n\\nUse conditional imports only in exceptional cases where the additional imports\\nneeded for type checking must be avoided at runtime. This pattern is\\ndiscouraged; alternatives such as refactoring the code to allow top-level\\nimports should be preferred.\\n\\nImports that are needed only for type annotations can be placed within an `if\\nTYPE_CHECKING:` block.\\n\\n-   Conditionally imported types need to be referenced as strings, to be forward\\n    compatible with Python 3.6 where the annotation expressions are actually\\n    evaluated.\\n-   Only entities that are used solely for typing should be defined here; this\\n    includes aliases. Otherwise it will be a runtime error, as the module will\\n    not be imported at runtime.\\n-   The block should be right after all the normal imports.\\n-   There should be no empty lines in the typing imports list.\\n-   Sort this list as if it were a regular imports list.\\n```python\\nimport typing\\nif typing.TYPE_CHECKING:\\n  import sketch\\ndef f(x: \"sketch.Sketch\"): ...\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.14 Circular Dependencies \\n\\nCircular dependencies that are caused by typing are code smells. Such code is a\\ngood candidate for refactoring. Although technically it is possible to keep\\ncircular dependencies, various build systems will not let you do so\\nbecause each module has to depend on the other.\\n\\nReplace modules that create circular dependency imports with `Any`. Set an\\n[alias](#typing-aliases) with a meaningful name, and use the real type name from\\nthis module (any attribute of `Any` is `Any`). Alias definitions should be\\nseparated from the last import by one line.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Any\\n\\nsome_mod = Any  # some_mod.py imports this module.\\n...\\n\\ndef my_method(self, var: \"some_mod.SomeType\") -> None:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### 3.19.15 Generics \\n\\nWhen annotating, prefer to specify type parameters for\\n[generic](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#generics) types in a\\nparameter list; otherwise, the generics\\' parameters will be assumed to be\\n[`Any`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#the-any-type).\\n\\n```python\\n# Yes:\\ndef get_names(employee_ids: Sequence[int]) -> Mapping[int, str]:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n# No:\\n# This is interpreted as get_names(employee_ids: Sequence[Any]) -> Mapping[Any, Any]\\ndef get_names(employee_ids: Sequence) -> Mapping:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nIf the best type parameter for a generic is `Any`, make it explicit, but\\nremember that in many cases [`TypeVar`](#typing-type-var) might be more\\nappropriate:\\n\\n```python\\n# No:\\ndef get_names(employee_ids: Sequence[Any]) -> Mapping[Any, str]:\\n  \"\"\"Returns a mapping from employee ID to employee name for given IDs.\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n# Yes:\\n_T = TypeVar(\\'_T\\')\\ndef get_names(employee_ids: Sequence[_T]) -> Mapping[_T, str]:\\n  \"\"\"Returns a mapping from employee ID to employee name for given IDs.\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 4 Parting Words \\n\\n*BE CONSISTENT*.\\n\\nIf you\\'re editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and\\ndetermine its style. If they use `_idx` suffixes in index variable names, you\\nshould too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them, make\\nyour comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.\\n\\nThe point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so\\npeople can concentrate on what you\\'re saying rather than on how you\\'re saying\\nit. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary, but local\\nstyle is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different\\nfrom the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when\\nthey go to read it.\\n\\nHowever, there are limits to consistency. It applies more heavily locally and on\\nchoices unspecified by the global style. Consistency should not generally be\\nused as a justification to do things in an old style without considering the\\nbenefits of the new style, or the tendency of the codebase to converge on newer\\nstyles over time.\\n\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Loading PDFs"],"metadata":{"id":"sH0MY7jGhFer"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["By using `PyPDFLoader` class, we were able to load a PDF file.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NpEsx40BDpC9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader\n","loader = PyPDFLoader(\"/content/META-Q2-2023-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf\")\n","pages = loader.load()"],"metadata":{"id":"XE01jtlul-hb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1758028156570,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":955,"user":{"displayName":"naveen b","userId":"07342808041236324682"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(pages) # 19 pages"],"metadata":{"id":"JkrwYbgnoERl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1758028160412,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":18,"user":{"displayName":"naveen b","userId":"07342808041236324682"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"9c0292e0-ac89-494a-d18a-60014c21a4aa"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["19"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Document Splitting\n"],"metadata":{"id":"UAmY6eyyD26U"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We need to create chunks from our document in order to get relevant answers from language models.

The Year of Efficiency was \n","always about two different goals: becoming an even stronger technology company, and improving our \n","financial results so we can invest aggressively in our ambitious long term roadmap. Now that we've\n","gotten through the major layoffs, the rest of 2023 will be about creating stability for employees, \n","removing barriers that slow us down, introducing new AI-powered tools to speed us up, and so on. \n","  \n","Over the next few months, we're going to start planning for 2024, and I'm going to be focused on \n","continuing to run the company as lean as possible for these cultural reasons even though our financial\n","results have improved. I expect that we’re still going to hire in key areas, but newly budgeted headcount \n","growth is going to be relatively low. That said, as part of this year's layoffs, many teams chose to let \n","people go in order to hire different people with different skills they need, so much of that hiring is going \n","to spill into 2024.\n","The other major budget point that we're working through is what the right level of AI capex is to support \n","our roadmap. Since we don't know how quickly our new AI products will grow, we may not have a clear \n","handle on this until later in the year.  \n","  \n","Moving onto our product roadmap, I've said on a number of these calls that the two technological \n","waves that we're riding are AI in the near term and the metaverse over the longer term.\n","Investments that we've made over the years in AI, including the billions of dollars we've spent on AI \n","infrastructure, are clearly paying off across our ranking and recommendation systems and improving \n","engagement and monetization. \n","  \n","AI-recommended content from accounts you don't follow is now the fastest growing category of content \n","on Facebook's feed. Since introducing these recommendations, they have driven a 7% increase in overall\n","time spent on the platform. This improves the experience because you can now discover things that you \n","might not have otherwise followed or come across. Reels is a key part of this Discovery Engine, and \n","Reels plays exceed 200 billion per day across Facebook and Instagram. We're seeing good progress on \n","Reels monetization as well, with the annual revenue run-rate across our apps now exceeding $10 billion, \n","up from $3 billion last fall.\n","Beyond Reels, AI is driving results across our monetization tools through our automated ads products, \n","which we call Meta Advantage. Almost all our advertisers are using at least one of our AI-driven \n","products. We've also deployed Meta Lattice, a new model architecture that learns to predict an ad's \n","performance across a variety of datasets and optimization goals. And we introduced AI Sandbox, a\n","testing playground for generative AI-powered tools like automatic text variation, background \n","generation, and image outcropping. \n","  \n","Business messaging is another key piece of our monetization strategy, and we recently announced that \n","the 200 million users of our WhatsApp Business app will now be able to create Click-to-WhatsApp ads \n","for Facebook and Instagram without needing a Facebook account. This is a pretty big unlock, particularly\n","in countries where WhatsApp is often the first step to bringing a business online. Paid messaging is a bit \n","earlier but is also showing good adoption. The number of businesses using our paid messaging products \n","has doubled year over year.\n","3 \n"," \n","While we're on messaging, I'll mention that we started rolling out Channels on WhatsApp last month. \n","It's a simple, reliable and private way to receive important updates from people and organizations, and \n","I'm quite excited for more people to try it as we bring the product to more countries through the rest of \n","this year. \n","  \n","Beyond the recommendations and ranking systems across our products, we're also building leading\n","foundation models to support a new generation of AI products. \n","  \n","We've partnered with Microsoft to open source Llama 2, the latest version of our large language model, \n","and make it available for both research and commercial use. We have a long history of open-sourcing \n","our infrastructure and AI work -- from PyTorch, which is the leading machine learning framework, to\n","models like Segment Anything, ImageBind, and Dino, to basic infrastructure as part of the Open \n","Compute Project. We've found that open sourcing our work allows the industry, including us, to benefit \n","from innovations that come from everywhere. And these are often improvements in safety and security, \n","since open source software is more scrutinized and more people can find and identify fixes for issues.\n","The improvements also often come in the form of efficiency gains, which should hopefully allow us and \n","others to run these models with less infrastructure investment going forward. I'm really looking forward \n","to seeing the improvements that the community makes to Llama 2. \n","  \n","We're also building a number of new products ourselves using Llama that will work across our services.\n","I'm going to share more details later this year, but you can imagine lots of ways AI could help people \n","connect and express themselves in our apps: creative tools that make it easier and more fun to share \n","content, agents that act as assistants, coaches, or that can help you interact with businesses and \n","creators, and more. These new products will improve everything that we do across both mobile apps\n","and the metaverse -- helping people create worlds and the avatars and objects that inhabit them as \n","well. \n","  \n","As our investments in AI continue, we remain fully committed to the metaverse vision as well. We've \n","been working on both of these two major priorities for many years in parallel now, and in many ways \n","the two areas are overlapping and complementary.\n","The next big thing on the Reality Labs side is the launch of our Quest 3 mixed reality headset at Connect. \n","It's our most powerful headset yet -- with better displays and resolution, and next gen Qualcomm \n","chipset with 2x the graphics performance. It will also have the best immersive content library out there, \n","and it's 40% thinner than Quest 2. Its mixed reality seamlessly blends your physical world and the virtual\n","one by intelligently understanding the physical space around you. We pioneered mixed reality with our \n","Quest Pro headset, and Quest 3 takes that to the next level. Others in the industry are of course working \n","on bringing mixed reality to the market too, but Quest 3 is going to be the first mainstream, accessible \n","device that we expect many millions of people will get to experience this technology with.\n","The metaverse content and software vision continues coming together as well. We recently announced \n","that Roblox is coming to Quest with an open beta on App Lab. For Horizon, the team is focused on \n","retention right now and we're making good progress on that. We've made big improvements on avatars \n","as well, and that’s going to be a bridge between our mobile apps and our VR and mixed reality\n","experiences. We'll have a lot more to share on both our metaverse and AI work at our Connect \n","conference, which we'll be hosting in Hacker Square at our headquarters on September 27th. It's going \n","to be a good one, so tune in!\n","4 \n"," \n","To wrap up, I just want to say I'm really proud of our teams for everything we've accomplished so far \n","this year. It's been a tough year in a lot of ways, but it’s also been an impactful one. I'm quite optimistic \n","about the road ahead and grateful to you all for being on this journey with us. Now, I’m going to hand it \n","over to Susan. \n"," \n","Susan Li, CFO \n"," \n","Thanks Mark and good afternoon everyone.\n","Let’s begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise \n","noted. \n"," \n","Q2 total revenue was $32.0 billion, up 11% or 12% on a constant currency basis. \n"," \n","Q2 total expenses were $22.6 billion, up 10% compared to last year. \n"," \n","In terms of the specific line items: \n","• Cost of revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by infrastructure-related costs.\n","• R&D increased 8%, driven mainly by headcount-related costs from our Reality Labs and Family \n","of Apps segments as well as restructuring costs. \n","• Marketing & Sales decreased 12%, due mostly to lower marketing spend and payroll-related \n","costs. \n","• G&A increased 39%, due primarily to an increase in legal accruals which was partially offset by \n","lower payroll-related costs.\n","We ended the second quarter with over 71,400 employees, down 7% from the first quarter. Our second \n","quarter headcount still included roughly half of the approximately 10,000 employees impacted by the \n","2023 layoffs. We expect that our third quarter headcount will no longer include the vast majority of \n","impacted employees. \n"," \n","Second quarter operating income was $9.4 billion, representing a 29% operating margin.\n","Our tax rate for the quarter was 16%. This is lower than our previous full-year outlook as our higher \n","share price provided a higher tax deduction and lowered our taxes.  \n"," \n","Net income was $7.8 billion or $2.98 per share. \n"," \n","Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $6.4 billion, driven by \n","investments in data centers, servers and network infrastructure.\n","Free cash flow was $11.0 billion, significantly benefitting from a deferral of income taxes that we expect \n","will be paid in the fourth quarter. We repurchased $793 million of our Class A common stock in the \n","second quarter and ended the quarter with $53.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. \n"," \n","Moving now to our segment results. \n","  \n","I’ll begin with our Family of Apps segment.\n","5 \n"," \n","Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow. We estimate that approximately 3.07 \n","billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in June, and that approximately \n","3.88 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. \n"," \n","Facebook continues to grow globally and engagement remains strong. For the first time, we crossed 3\n","billion monthly active users, with Facebook MAU ending at 3.03 billion in June, up 3% or 96 million \n","compared to last year. Facebook daily active users were 2.06 billion, up 5% or 96 million. DAUs \n","represented approximately 68% of MAUs. \n"," \n","Q2 Total Family of Apps revenue was $31.7 billion, up 12% year over year. \n"," \n","Q2 Family of Apps ad revenue was $31.5 billion, up 12% or 13% on a constant currency basis.\n","Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, \n","followed by entertainment & media and CPG. Online commerce benefited from strong spend among \n","advertisers in China reaching customers in other markets. \n"," \n","On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World at 16%, followed by\n","Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific at 14%, 11% and 10%, respectively. Foreign currency was a \n","headwind to advertising revenue growth in all international regions.  \n"," \n","In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 34% and the average \n","price per ad decreased 16%. Impression growth was primarily driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World.\n","The year-over-year decline in pricing was driven by strong impression growth, especially from lower \n","monetizing surfaces and regions. While overall pricing remains under pressure from these factors, we \n","believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved \n","results for advertisers. \n"," \n","Family of Apps other revenue was $225 million in Q2, up 3%, as strong business messaging revenue\n","growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform was partially offset by a decline in other line items. \n"," \n","We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our \n","Family of Apps. In Q2, Family of Apps expenses were $18.6 billion, representing approximately 82% of \n","our overall expenses. FoA expenses were up 8% due primarily to legal-related expenses and\n","restructuring charges, partially offset by a decrease in non headcount-related operating expenses, \n","including marketing. \n"," \n","Family of Apps operating income was $13.1 billion, representing a 41% operating margin. \n"," \n","Within our Reality Labs segment, Q2 revenue was $276 million, down 39% due to lower Quest 2 sales. \n","Reality Labs expenses were $4.0 billion, up 23% due to lapping a reduction in Reality Labs loss reserves\n","in Q2 of last year as well as growth in employee-related costs. \n"," \n","Reality Labs operating loss was $3.7 billion. \n"," \n","Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue \n","performance: Our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at \n","monetizing that engagement over time.\n","6 \n"," \n"," \n","On the first - overall engagement within Facebook and Instagram remains strong. Reels continues to \n","grow and drive incremental engagement. On Facebook Feed in particular, recommended content from \n","accounts you don't follow has increased significantly over the past year while also becoming more \n","incremental to engagement - demonstrating that people are getting added value from discovering\n","content from unconnected accounts. Looking forward, we are optimistic about our ability to increase \n","that value even further by leveraging advanced AI techniques to improve recommendations. \n"," \n","In addition to improving the value people get within our family of apps today, we’re also investing in \n","entirely new experiences for the future. We’re standing up infrastructure to support new AI-powered\n","products across our services, which will give people more tools to express themselves and connect. And \n","we’ve been pleased with the initial reception of our new standalone app, Threads, since its launch \n","earlier this month. Our focus now is on further developing this into a product that will be valuable for a \n","large set of people over time. \n"," \n","Moving to the other driver of revenue - improving monetization. Here, we’re focused on improving\n","monetization efficiency of products that monetize at lower rates today, like Reels and our messaging \n","services; and, more broadly, driving measurable performance and returns for our advertisers. \n"," \n","On Reels, we are making good progress on monetization, with more than 3/4 of our advertisers now \n","using Reels ads. We remain focused on further reducing the Reels revenue headwind and narrowing the\n","monetization efficiency gap with our more mature surfaces. However, we continue to expect time on \n","Reels will monetize at a lower rate than Stories and Feed for the foreseeable future since people scroll \n","more slowly through video content. \n"," \n","Within messaging, billions of people and millions of businesses use our messaging services every day to\n","connect. We see a significant opportunity to build tools and functionality for businesses to help facilitate \n","those interactions and are seeing early but promising progress with WhatsApp’s paid messaging solution \n","today. \n"," \n","In terms of our work to drive measurable performance for advertisers - it’s concentrated in two primary \n","areas: AI and onsite conversions.\n","• We’re leveraging AI to move our systems towards using fewer, larger models that enable us to \n","leverage learnings across product surfaces and deploy improvements more quickly, broadly, and \n","efficiently. We’re also leveraging AI to power advanced ads products, like Advantage+ shopping, \n","which continues to gain adoption. We’re seeing this work translate into results for advertisers as \n","conversion growth remained strong in Q2.\n","• In terms of driving onsite conversions, we continue to see strong results with Click-to-messaging \n","ads and are well positioned given our suite of messaging applications. Daily Click-to-WhatsApp \n","ads revenue continues to grow very quickly at over 80% year-over-year. We also recently started \n","testing the ability to buy Click-to-WhatsApp ads directly from the WhatsApp Business App,\n","which now has more than 200 million monthly users. Looking ahead, we’re focused on enabling \n","businesses to optimize for conversions further down the funnel in our messaging applications. \n","We are also investing in scaling other onsite objectives like lead generation and Shops ads. \n"," \n","Before turning to our revenue outlook, I’d also like to talk about our investment philosophy. We expect\n","to bring the discipline and habits that we built during this year of efficiency with us as we plan for the \n","future. At the same time, we remain focused on investing in the significant opportunities ahead. Part of\n","7 \n"," \n","supporting these initiatives will come from prioritizing them against other areas of work and shifting \n","resources. However, in some cases they will require incremental investment. This is particularly true in \n","the areas we see the most significant opportunity, which include AI and the metaverse.  \n"," \n","As I mentioned last quarter, we also remain focused on modestly evolving our capital structure over\n","time. We were pleased to execute our second bond offering in May and expect a measured pace of \n","future debt raises as we work toward improving our overall cost of capital while maintaining a positive \n","or neutral net cash balance. \n"," \n","In addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape. With respect to EU-U.S. data \n","transfers, we saw a positive development with the European Commission’s adoption of a final adequacy\n","decision, which allows us to continue to provide our services in Europe. This is good news, though \n","broadly speaking, we continue to see increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US \n","that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. \n"," \n","Turning now to the revenue outlook. \n"," \n","We expect third quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $32-34.5 billion. Our guidance assumes\n","a foreign currency tailwind of approximately 3% to year-over-year total revenue growth in the third \n","quarter, based on current exchange rates. \n"," \n","Turning now to the expense outlook. \n"," \n","We anticipate that our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $88-91 billion, increased \n","from our prior range of $86-90 billion due to legal-related expenses recorded in Q2. This outlook\n","includes approximately $4 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and \n","severance and other personnel costs. We expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year \n","in 2023. \n"," \n","While we are not providing a quantitative outlook beyond 2023 at this point, we expect a few factors to \n","be drivers of total expense growth in 2024 as we continue to invest in our most compelling\n","opportunities, including AI and the metaverse. \n","• First, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs next year. Given our increased capital \n","investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger \n","amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger \n","infrastructure footprint. \n","• Second, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we evolve our workforce composition\n","toward higher-cost technical roles. \n","• Finally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due \n","to our ongoing product development efforts in AR/VR and our investments to further scale our \n","ecosystem. \n"," \n","Turning now to the capex outlook. \n"," \n","We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $27-30 billion, lowered from our prior estimate of\n","$30-33 billion. The reduced forecast is due to both cost savings, particularly on non-AI servers, as well as \n","shifts in capex into 2024 from delays in projects and equipment deliveries rather than a reduction in \n","overall investment plans.\n","8 \n"," \n"," \n","Looking ahead, while we continue to refine our plans as we progress throughout the year, we currently \n","expect total capital expenditures to grow in 2024, driven by our investments across both data centers \n","and servers, particularly in support of our AI work. \n"," \n","On to tax. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect the tax rate for the rest of the year to be \n","similar to Q2 2023.\n","In closing, Q2 was a good quarter for our business. We’re executing well across our core priorities and \n","are continuing to make progress on delivering exciting new experiences for our community. \n"," \n","With that, Dave, let’s open up the call for questions. \n"," \n","Operator:  Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. \n"," \n","Brian Nowak:  Maybe a two-parter for Mark. Mark, you've spoken a few times over the last few\n","months on AI agents and sort of building different types of assistants through Llama. \n","I guess the two-part question is, can you just sort of talk to us a little bit about some \n","of the use cases or consumer advertiser offerings you're most excited about \n","enabling for some of these AI agents? And then the second one, just to sort of level \n","set on timing a bit, can you just help us understand some of the larger technological\n","barriers in your mind the teams will need to overcome to really scale these types of \n","agent products across the ecosystem? Thanks. \n"," \n","Mark Zuckerberg: Sure. So I think the main thing that I'll say on this for now is tune in to Connect \n","coming up in September. We're going to have a lot more to talk about on the \n","roadmap and products that we're launching. We wanted to get the Llama 2 model\n","out now. That's going to be -- that's going to underpin a lot of the new things that \n","we're building. And now we're nailing down a bunch of these additional products, \n","and this is going to be stuff that we're working on for years. But I think a lot of the \n","journey will kind of start later this year when we start rolling out some of these \n","things. \n"," \n","But overall, I think that there are three basic categories of products or technologies\n","that we're planning on building with generative AI. One are around different kinds \n","of agents, which I'll talk about in a second. Two are just kind of generative AI-\n","powered features. So some of the canonical examples of that are things like in \n","advertising, helping advertisers basically run ads without needing to supply as much \n","creative or if they have an image but it doesn't fit the format, be able to fill in the\n","image for them. So I talked about that a little bit upfront in my comments. But \n","there's stuff like that across every app. \n"," \n","And then the third category of things, I'd say, are broadly focused on productivity \n","and efficiency internally. So everything from helping engineers write code faster to \n","helping people internally understand the overall knowledge base at the company \n","and things like that. So there's a lot to do on each of those zones.\n","9 \n"," \n","For AI agents specifically, I guess what I'd say is one of the things that's different \n","about how we think about this compared to some others in the industry is we don't \n","think that there's going to be one single AI that people interact with, just because \n","there are all these different entities on a day-to-day basis that people come across, \n","whether they're different creators or different businesses or different apps or things\n","that you use. So I think that there are going to be a handful of things that are just \n","sort of focused on helping people connect around expression and creativity and \n","facilitating connections. \n"," \n","I think there are going to be a handful of experiences around helping people \n","connect with the creators who they care about and helping creators foster their \n","communities. And then the one that I think is going to have the fastest direct\n","business loop is going to be around helping people interact with businesses. You can \n","imagine a world on this where over time, every business has as an AI agent that \n","basically people can message and interact with. And it's going to take some time to \n","get there, right? I mean, this is going to be a long road to build that out. \n"," \n","But I think that, that's going to improve a lot of the interactions that people have\n","with businesses as well as if that does work, it should alleviate one of the biggest \n","issues that we're currently having around messaging monetization is that in order to \n","-- for a person to interact with a business, it's quite human labor-intensive for a \n","person to be on the other side of that interaction, which is one of the reasons why \n","we've seen this take off in some countries where the cost of labor is relatively low.\n","But you can imagine in a world where every business has an AI agent, that we can \n","see the kind of success that we're seeing in Thailand or Vietnam with business \n","messaging could kind of spread everywhere. And I think that's quite exciting. But \n","overall, I think we're going to follow a playbook that's similar to what we normally \n","do on products.  \n"," \n","In terms of how quickly some of these new products scale, that's one of the big\n","unknowns for the business and one of the things that we're debating heavily when \n","thinking through the amount of AI CapEx to bring online because the reality is we \n","just don't know how quickly these will scale. And we want to have the capacity in \n","place in case they scale very quickly. But because they're kind of brand-new things, \n","there aren't that many precedents for things like this. It's actually quite hard to \n","forecast.\n","So I don't know, Susan, if there's anything on that last point that you want to jump \n","in on. But I think that's probably all I'll say on this for now. But I'm really excited \n","about the segment. This is just going to be -- it fits into all the different products \n","that we're building really well. I think that this is going to both complement and \n","touch and transform every single thing that we're doing, and I'm really excited for it.\n","So tune in to Connect. \n"," \n","Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\n","10 \n"," \n","Eric Sheridan:  Maybe one for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, just following up on Brian's question. I \n","did want to ask just to draw that out a little bit more, how you think about the \n","extensions of the developer community sort of growing up around a platform like \n","Llama 2. And we were intrigued by the Microsoft announcement. You traditionally \n","have been more of a consumer-facing company with product. Could this provide\n","you an avenue to be more of an enterprise-facing company over the long term? And \n","is there a strategy there that maybe we haven't seen from you in the past? I'd love \n","to flesh that out a little bit. \n"," \n","And Susan, just one for you. The RL losses just continue to build. And I think we \n","continue to struggle a little bit of what drivers of those losses are and how should \n","we think about some of the components driving the losses versus elements of\n","earning a return on those losses over the medium to long term as Mark sort of \n","framed the time frame around metaverse. So any color there about sort of rate of \n","change or components of the losses in RL, I think, would be super helpful. \n"," \n","Mark Zuckerberg: Yes, sure. I'll take a cut at both of those, and Susan can jump into the second one if \n","there's anything that she wants to add there as well. All right. So Llama is an open\n","source project, which is a little bit different from building out a developer platform, \n","although there will be an ecosystem around this. What we've seen around open \n","source work that we've done, which we've done a lot of in our core infrastructure \n","work, design of servers and data centers and basic infrastructure as well as in AI. \n","And I pointed out some of these in my remarks upfront, like PyTorch and just a\n","bunch of other models that we've released recently. \n"," \n","One of the things that we've seen is that when you release these projects publicly \n","and open source, there tend to be a few categories of innovations that the \n","community makes. So on the one hand, I think it's just good to get the community \n","standardized on the work that we're doing. That helps with recruiting because a lot\n","of the best people want to come and work at the place that is building the things \n","that everyone else uses. It makes sense that people are used to these tools from \n","wherever else they're working. They can come here and build here. \n"," \n","But in terms of improvements that we expect to see from the community, there are \n","really a few different types. One is specifically around safety and security. That's a\n","very important issue in AI. In open source software overall, we've just seen through \n","the history here that open-source software gets scrutinized more and therefore \n","ends up being more secure and safer. And we think that there's a very good chance \n","that's the likely outcome here. And whatever improvements that people make to \n","harden it in the community, we'll be able to roll that into our work, both for the\n","first-party products that we'll launch as well as making it easy to propagate that \n","across the industry and make the AI that everyone uses safer. \n"," \n","I would also hope to see efficiency improvements. I mean, even from the initial \n","Llama that was just released as a research project, some of the improvements are \n","around things like quantization and being able to run the model way more\n","efficiently. Now we're spending so much on AI CapEx that all the help that we can \n","get from the community to make this stuff more efficient to run, will be helpful not\n","11 \n"," \n","just for individuals to be able to run powerful models on their laptop or locally or \n","without a huge amount of compute, so individuals can afford it. But that should \n","hopefully translate over time into just a more efficient infrastructure for us, which \n","hopefully could be quite a big savings. So that's more what we're seeing there. \n"," \n","We partnered with Microsoft specifically because we don't have a public cloud\n","offering. So this isn't about us getting into that. It's actually the opposite. We want \n","to work with them because they have that and others have that, and that was the \n","thing that we aren't planning on building out. But one of the things that you might \n","have noticed is in addition to making this open through the open source license, we \n","did include a term that for the largest companies, specifically ones that are going to\n","have public cloud offerings, that they don't just get a free license to use this. They'll \n","need to come and make a business arrangement with us. \n"," \n","And our intent there is we want everyone to be using this. We want this to be open. \n","But if you're someone like Microsoft or Amazon or Google and you're going to \n","basically be reselling these services, that's something that we think we should get\n","some portion of the revenue for. So those are the deals that we intend to be \n","making, and we've started doing that a little bit. I don't think that that's going to be \n","a large amount of revenue in the near term. But over the long term, hopefully, that \n","can be something. \n"," \n","Not sure if there's anything else to add on that, but Susan, you can jump in if you \n","want. On RL, let me just jump over to that for a second. I don't think we're going to\n","break out numbers right now but I'll defer to Susan on that. I mean, one big thing \n","for the next year is the launch of Quest 3, right? And basically, this is going to be the \n","biggest headset that we've released since 2020 when we came out with Quest 2. \n","And there are just a lot of expenses related to bringing that to market. And I think \n","that's, at least in the near term, going to be one of the major drivers of this.\n","So I think that's probably the main thing that I would point to there. We're \n","continuing to -- I continue to think, looking at the VR work that we're doing and the \n","AR work, some of the neural interfaces work, I think we're leading in these areas. It's \n","been good to see what others in the industry have done because to some degree, it \n","gives us more confidence that we're on the right track.\n","And even though I know from an investor standpoint, most people aren't investing \n","on quite as long of a time horizon as we are here, so I kind of get that, a lot of \n","investors might want to see us spending less here in the near term. My view is that \n","we are leading in these areas. I believe that they're going to be big over time. I think \n","we've shown that we can deliver good business results in the near term while\n","investing ambitiously in the long term. So I'm planning on continuing to do that, and \n","I do continue to believe that over time, we will be happy that we did that. So I don't \n","know if Susan, if there's anything you wanted to add there. \n"," \n","Susan Li:  Sure. Let me just add a couple of things. Very quickly on the first question, I just \n","want to clarify that we don't expect that Llama is going to result in a separate\n","topline enterprise revenue line, so just making sure we're totally clear.\n","12 \n"," \n"," \n","On the second question about the growth in Reality Labs operating losses in 2024, \n","Mark alluded to the fact that this is an ambitious long-term horizon multifaceted \n","roadmap. There are lots of components to the Reality Labs portfolio across VR, AR, \n","metaverse social platforms, neural interfaces. \n"," \n","And we really have a long-term time horizon for evaluating the return on our\n","investments here. So in the near term, we're focused on growing adoption of the \n","existing products, and we're constantly learning more about demand and use cases \n","that inform our future plans. But a lot of the investment that's driving the growth \n","here is around conducting the fundamental R&D to solve hard technology problems \n","that are going to enable our vision here. A lot of it is around clearing technical\n","hurdles that will make subsequent devices smaller, cost less, weigh less, et cetera. \n","So that's really on the Reality Labs side. \n"," \n","Again, as we said, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-\n","year in 2024. In 2024, specifically, I think that will be driven by a combination of \n","both headcount-related and operating costs. But again, our ambitions in Reality\n","Labs haven't changed, and it continues to be a significant long-term opportunity for \n","us. \n"," \n","Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. \n"," \n","Mark Shmulik:  Mark, things move quickly. Like a month ago, we weren't talking about Reels. A \n","quarter ago, we weren't talking about Llama, and start of the year, we were barely \n","talking about AI. If you think back to kind of just how you were prioritizing your time\n","at the start of the year to kind of where you are today and how that's kind of \n","changed, would love to just get some color on kind of the changing priorities and \n","really where you're spending your time. \n"," \n","And then the second question, really impressive, obviously, acceleration of growth \n","in kind of the core ad business. Would love to just get some color kind of beyond the\n","vertical contribution. What are you seeing in terms of kind of adoption of \n","Advantage+ products really driving some of that improved growth, especially what \n","we've seen relative to the rest of the sector? \n"," \n","Mark Zuckerberg: Yes. I can start with the first and then Susan can take the second. I actually think our \n","priorities have been pretty consistent for a few years now. I think the way that\n","people hear them might be different. But for example, last year, I think we were \n","getting quite a bit of critique for the volume of AI CapEx spending that we were \n","doing, and now obviously, people want to understand where that's going and where \n","we think that trajectory is going and want to make it as efficient as possible. But I \n","think at this point, it's more well understood that I think that was a good\n","investment, and it's driving results in the near term and enabling us to build some of \n","the new experiences that I think we all think are pretty fundamental. \n"," \n","I don't think Reels is new, although maybe you meant Threads when you said that. \n","Threads, I would say it's not that -- Threads is like -- it's not a massive project. It was\n","13 \n"," \n","-- I've thought for a while that the opportunity around public conversations and kind \n","of a text-based product was bigger than what had been executed yet in the market. \n","So we had a relatively small team work on that. And this year, I think there have \n","been two things that have been -- that have just vastly exceeded my expectations. \n","One was Llama, the initial model, we thought it was interesting, but the scale of\n","adoption, even just for the research version really spurred us to go do Llama 2, and \n","that was vastly more than we expected. \n"," \n","And the second is Threads has been dramatically more than we expected in terms of \n","the adoption and the rate of that. We thought this was going to be kind of a project \n","that we just -- we had a small team working on for a while, but it really kind of blew\n","up and created a big opportunity immediately. But no, I mean, I think over time, you \n","should expect that we're going to focus on AI and the metaverse. AI includes both \n","all of the ranking and recommendation systems that power the core apps, so all the \n","content that you're seeing in Facebook and Instagram, all the ads content that \n","you're seeing. It also underpins all the safety systems that we build.\n","And increasingly, it's all the generative AI stuff, so all the agents, all the generative \n","features that we're going to be rolling out and a lot of the other work that's going to \n","underly some of the efficiency stuff that we're doing internally. And then the \n","metaverse stuff, I think we've talked about for a while. So I don't think that there's \n","much change there, except that I'd say the signals that we're getting from the\n","market are it's certainly not getting adopted a lot faster than we expected so that's \n","sort of the somewhat sobering signal. \n"," \n","But on the other side, I think a lot of companies that otherwise are doing, we \n","respect and do great work, we don't necessarily view as building things that are \n","ahead of where we are, which gives us confidence that we think that the long-term\n","thesis still will hold there. We think that we're going to be the leaders in it. And \n","nothing that we're seeing from the market makes us rethink that in a fundamental \n","way. So I think we're going to continue focusing on AI and the metaverse as the two \n","big thrusts of what we're doing and all the other things kind of fall out of that. \n"," \n","Susan Li:  And Mark, I'll take the second question that you asked around the Q2 revenue\n","acceleration. So I think there were a couple of parts. One was around the \n","acceleration in the core ads business. The second was on the Advantage+ products. \n","In terms of the Q2 revenue acceleration, I'd highlight there are a few factors driving \n","that. The first is, frankly, we're lapping a weaker demand period, including the first \n","full quarter of the war in Ukraine and the suspension of our services in Russia.\n","Second, we saw increased supply and improvements to ad performance, including \n","improved Reels monetization as we continue to work down the Reels revenue \n","headwind. And third, there were lower FX headwinds for us this quarter. So those \n","were all three things that helped drive the revenue acceleration in Q2. \n"," \n","In terms of the question about Advantage+ specifically, Advantage+ is one of\n","multiple AI-powered ad products that we have right now in the market. With \n","Advantage+ specifically, we're seeing strong adoption and particular success with\n","14 \n"," \n","the e-commerce and retail verticals, and we've seen good traction with other \n","verticals like CPG, especially DTC brands, and we're continuing to launch features to \n","unlock use cases for advertisers and make it easier for them to adopt Advantage+ \n","campaigns and measure their performance gains. So we've got a lot in the pipeline \n","there that we're excited about for both the Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns\n","specifically, which were our first sort of foray into this area, but then the \n","Advantage+ portfolio more broadly that basically enables us to take that same \n","playbook of helping advertisers iterate and test very quickly and apply it to many \n","different steps of the end-to-end ad buying experience. \n"," \n","So the feedback and results that we've seen from advertisers is good, and we think\n","it's a really promising area that we're continuing to invest in. But it's one of many \n","ways that we're using AI to continue to sort of help make our ads systems and \n","recommendations and ranking engines, more performant to deliver better \n","measurement and results to advertisers. \n"," \n","Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill \n","Lynch.\n","Justin Post:  I guess I want to follow up on Reality Labs, passing $40 billion in losses and \n","increasing annually next year. Just think about -- maybe help us understand how the \n","ROI on the business, how you're thinking about that investment, either on a stand-\n","alone basis or as a complement to the Family of Apps, if you're thinking about it \n","from an investor perspective.\n","Mark Zuckerberg:  Well, I think it's both over time. The primary way that I think about this is that we've \n","been able to show that we can -- we've been quite successful at building large-scale \n","social experiences within the constraints of platforms that often our competitors are \n","defining. I think we're going to be able to do even better work. And there's a lot of\n","things that I would like to see us build that we just can't because we're -- of the \n","ways that we're constrained by the competitors who build these platforms. \n"," \n","And over time, the main way that I think about this is from a product and mission \n","perspective is we're here to build awesome experiences that help people connect. I \n","think helping to shape the next platform is going to unlock that in a profound way\n","for decades to come. And that's what I'm here to do and I think what a lot of people \n","are here to do. So that's kind of the first principles part of this. \n"," \n","From a business perspective, I think that there's going to end up being a large \n","business component of this that is Reality Labs-specific. Directly, the products that \n","we're building there and having that be a good business. But I also think that a lot of\n","this is going to be that it unlocks a lot of value for the other experiences, the current \n","apps that we have, what you think of as the Family of Apps, where we currently, just \n","a lot of the potential value, whether it's just engagement that could be created, \n","features that we would love to build that we're not allowed to because Apple or \n","others just don't allow us to build those things. And I think that that's really\n","unfortunate for the industry.\n","15 \n"," \n","I think that there's a lot of lost engagement that would have happened, a lot of the \n","monetization and value that gets created. I mean, just look at what happened with \n","App Tracking Transparency, the massive value destruction for small businesses \n","because of the rules that were set by another platform. And that's not -- in a future \n","version of the world, it's not -- that would be recognized not by device sales or some\n","new, like, experience that we're building in Reality Labs. You would basically see \n","that accrue through more efficient monetization of the apps and experiences that \n","we're building in other places. So I think it's going to be both. \n"," \n","But I think this is just a very fundamental thing. This is a very long-term bet. At a \n","deep level, I understand the discomfort that a lot of investors have with it because\n","it's just outside of the model of, I think, even most long-term investors, how you \n","would think about this. And look, I mean, I can't guarantee you that I'm going to be \n","right about this bet. I do think that this is the direction that the world is going in. \n","There are 1 billion or 2 billion people who have glasses today. I think in the future, \n","they're all going to be smart glasses.\n","And all the time that we spend on TVs and computers, I think that's going to get \n","more immersive and look something more like VR in the future. And I think that \n","what we're seeing is richer ways for people to communicate across even the mobile \n","apps that we have going from text to photos to videos, just a continual trend \n","towards being more immersive. So like all of these trends line up to make me think \n","that this is the right thing.\n","I think we're going to be happy that we did this. So that's kind of how I think about \n","it, both from kind of a mission and product perspective, a business perspective, an \n","investment time frame perspective. But I also understand the discomfort that some \n","folks have with something that I can't put exact numbers on a near-term time \n","horizon around. \n"," \n","Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n","Doug Anmuth:  One for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, you touched on it a bit, but can you just talk a \n","little bit more about what you've learned from Threads early on, not just for that \n","product specifically but also as you look to leverage the Family of Apps platform to \n","launch additional products over time. And then, Susan, you lowered the CapEx \n","outlook this year by $3 billion. Can you just provide more color on the delays in\n","projects and equipment in '23? And is there any way to frame how meaningful the \n","CapEx increase could be in '24? \n"," \n","Mark Zuckerberg:  Yes. On Threads, it's maybe too early to do this kind of analysis. I mean, I'm -- on the \n","one hand, we've tried a bunch of standalone experiences over time, and in general, \n","we haven't had a lot of success with building kind of standalone apps. The biggest\n","exception to that, of course, is Messenger, but that started off as functionality inside \n","Facebook and was spun out. So part of me wonders if this is just a kind of classic \n","venture capital portfolio question, where you try a bunch of things and a bunch of \n","them don't work. And then every once in a while, one hits and is a much bigger \n","success. It could be that.\n","16 \n"," \n"," \n","Or it could just be that this is such an idiosyncratic case because of all of the factors \n","that are happening around Twitter or X, I guess, it's called now. So it's hard to say. I \n","mean, but I think when something works or doesn't, you can often point to the \n","reason why it did or didn't. And I think it is an interesting intellectual question of \n","whether you could have known that a priori, that, that was actually going to be the \n","case.\n","So I'm not sure. But also rather than trying to kind of analyze that, I'd say we have a \n","lot of work to do to really make Threads reach its full potential. That's not a \n","foregone conclusion yet even though I think we're off to a great start, and I'm \n","optimistic that over time, this could be a fifth great app in the Family of Apps. But \n","we have a lot of basic work to do.\n","And we have a basic playbook here, which is build an experience. It's got to be \n","something that people like so it has to have product market fit. Once you get that, \n","it's not always retentive. So a lot of people might like an experience but you need to \n","kind of tune it so that way the numbers works so that people who use it are \n","continuing. We feel like we're getting to a good place on that with Threads. There's\n","still a lot of basic functionality to build. \n"," \n","Once we feel like we're in a very good place on that, then I'm highly confident that \n","we're going to be able to pour enough gasoline on this to help it grow once we get \n","to the point where we feel good that everyone who's using it is going to continue \n","using it at a high rate. And then a few years, once we get to the point where it's at\n","hundreds of millions of people, assuming we can get there, then we'll worry about \n","monetization. But I mean, that's basically the playbook that we're focused on. \n"," \n","And so rather than thinking about right now, like what does this mean for other \n","things like it that we can build, I'd say we're really just focused on taking this \n","opportunity, which is an awesome one that we didn't expect to this scale and\n","making sure we make the most of this and execute it. But I do think it has been sort \n","of this weird anomalous thing in the tech industry that there hasn't been an app for \n","public discussions like this that has reached 1 billion people. \n"," \n","When I look at all the different social experiences, it just seems like there should be \n","one like this. I think there are a lot of reasons that you can point to why that might\n","have not been the case historically. But it's awesome that we get a chance to work \n","on this and I'm really optimistic about where we are. But it's going to be a long road \n","ahead. \n"," \n","Susan Li:  And Doug, on your second question about our 2023 CapEx forecast and the impact \n","on '24, so I'll start with 2023. The reduced forecast that we gave for '23, I mentioned \n","on the call, is driven both by some cost savings, particularly on non-AI servers,\n","where were -- we previously had some underutilized capacity, and we've been \n","identifying ways to be more efficient in the way that we allocate that capacity \n","towards all of our various needs, as well as shifts in CapEx into 2024 that's coming\n","17 \n"," \n","from delays in data center projects and server deliveries. And that will just push that \n","associated CapEx, which we were planning for in '23 into '24. \n"," \n","We're still working on our '24 CapEx plans. We haven't yet finalized that, and we'll \n","be working on that through the course of this year. But I mentioned that we expect \n","that CapEx in '24 will be higher than in '23. We expect both data center spend to\n","grow in '24 as we ramp up construction on sites with the new data center \n","architecture that we announced late last year. And then we certainly also expect to \n","invest more in servers in 2024 for both AI workloads to support all of the AI work \n","that we've talked about across the core AI ranking, recommendation work along \n","with the next-gen AI efforts. And then, of course, also our non-AI workloads as we\n","refresh some of our servers and add capacity just to support continued growth \n","across the site. \n"," \n","Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist. \n"," \n","Youssef Squali:  One for Mark and one for Susan maybe. Mark, you touched on this a little earlier, \n","but there is this open source versus closed source debate going on with Meta as one \n","of the companies on one side of it with Llama and Llama 2. How do you see this\n","market evolving over time? Do you see one approach as being potentially superior \n","to the other, and therefore, would be likely to garner greater adoption? Or is this \n","really a win-win situation, just considering how early we are in this process and how \n","largely potential TAM is? \n"," \n","And then Susan, your guidance for Q3 implies at the midpoint about a 20% growth, \n","which is a pretty steep acceleration from Q2 at 11% or 12%. Could you maybe just\n","help us understand the drivers of that acceleration? And as we look into Q4, the \n","comps remain pretty easy. Is that sustainable to year-end? \n"," \n","Mark Zuckerberg:  Yes, I can speak briefly to the first one. I do think that there will continue to be both \n","open and closed AI models. I think there are a bunch of reasons for this. There are \n","obviously a lot of companies that their business model is to build a model and then\n","sell access to it. So for them, making it open would undermine their business model. \n","That is not our business model. We want to have the -- like we view the model that \n","we're building as sort of the foundation for building products. So if by sharing it, we \n","can improve the quality of the model and improve the quality of the team that we \n","have that is working on that, that's a win for our business of basically building better \n","products.\n","So I think you'll see both of those models. There are also some important safety \n","questions that I think we'll need to continue thinking about over time. There are a \n","number of people who are out there saying that once the AI models get past a \n","certain level of capability, it can become dangerous for them to become just in the \n","hands of everyone openly. I think -- what I think is pretty clear is that we're not at\n","that point today. I think that there's consensus generally among people who are \n","working on this in the industry and policy folks that we're not at that point today. \n","And it's not exactly clear at what point you reach that.\n","18 \n"," \n","So I think there are people who are kind of making that argument in good faith, who \n","are actually concerned about the safety risk. I think that there are probably some \n","businesses that are out there making that argument because they want it to be \n","more closed, because that's their business so I think we need to be wary of that. But \n","I think for both of those reasons, the business reasons and the safety reasons, I\n","think there will continue to be a mix of open and closed models, and it's not just \n","going to be like one thing is what everyone uses. I think different businesses will use \n","different things for different reasons. \n"," \n","And by open sourcing Llama now, we're not -- on the second question around \n","safety, we intentionally did not go out there and say we're going to open source\n","every single thing in the future because we do want to have the space to be able to \n","look at how the safety landscape evolves. And if we think that we do cross some \n","kind of critical threshold in the future, it may not be the right thing to open source it \n","in the future. But for our business model at least, since we're not selling access to \n","this stuff, it's a lot easier for us to share this with the community because it just\n","makes our products better and other people’s, and that, I think, is a really healthy \n","dynamic for the industry. \n"," \n","Susan Li:  And thanks, Youssef, for your second question, which I'll take. You asked about our \n","Q3 revenue outlook and maybe also what that implies looking forward into Q4. So \n","on the further acceleration that we've guided to in Q3, first of all, I'd just point out\n","that Q3'22 revenue declined 4.5% year-over-year so we're really lapping a much \n","weaker demand period a year ago, and we've certainly seen demand this year \n","stabilize and so it's really a much easier compare. \n"," \n","We also are expecting that currency is going to flip to a 3-point tailwind from a 1-\n","point headwind last quarter. And finally, as I've mentioned earlier on this call, we've\n","been investing for a long time and I think executing really well across our core \n","monetization work and continuing to grow engagement. And I think we're going to \n","benefit from all of the investments that we've made in those historical and key \n","priorities for us. \n"," \n","In terms of what this means for Q4, we're not sharing a Q4 revenue outlook yet. \n","There are obviously some tailwinds to year-over-year growth in Q4. Again, the same\n","point about a weaker compare applies. And at current rates, FX would be a larger \n","tailwind in Q4 than we're expecting it to be in Q3. But we've had sizable fluctuations \n","in advertiser demand over the last year. It's been a pretty volatile period. So while \n","we're seeing strong advertiser demand now and that's certainly informing our \n","outlook, it's harder to predict as we look further forward, and there are a wide\n","range of possible outcomes in Q4. \n"," \n","Kenneth Dorell:  Dave, we have time for one last question. \n"," \n","Operator:  That will come from the line of Brad Erickson with RBC Capital Markets. \n"," \n","Bradley Erickson:  Just had a follow-up, I guess, on the CapEx. Just in that planning process you keep \n","alluding to for the '24 CapEx outlook, I think a lot of your commentary here implies\n","19 \n"," \n","that new products, it sounds like are going to be really central to instructing that \n","number. Just curious how dependent it also is based on just views of revenue \n","growth in '24 and the relationship there. \n"," \n","Susan Li:  Yes. Thank you, Brad. I can go ahead and take that one. So our growth in AI \n","investments is really the thing that is driving the growth in our 2024 CapEx outlook.\n","And I think there are a couple of components to that. There is both the core AI \n","work, which powers our ranking and recommendation systems, which underpins \n","both a lot of our content ranking and engagement growth as well as the \n","monetization work. And that's an area where we're able to measure the ROI of our \n","investments there, and we feel good about the ROI of those investments. And we\n","want to continue investing appropriately to drive revenue growth, at the same time \n","being mindful of our desire to, over the long term, decrease capital intensity. \n"," \n","There's also another component, which is the next-generation AI efforts that we've \n","talked about around advanced research and gen AI, and that's a place where we're \n","already standing up training clusters and inference capacity. But we don't know\n","exactly what we'll need in 2024 since we don't have any at-scale deployments yet of \n","consumer business-facing features. And the scale of the adoption of those products \n","is ultimately going to inform how much capacity we need. \n"," \n","We think these are both going to be compelling investment opportunities and some \n","of the AI capacity is fungible, so if we don't need -- end up needing some of the\n","capacity for our gen AI work, we'll be able to allocate it to our core AI work, \n","supporting ads and engagement. But we're really still working on our '24 plans. We \n","will have a clearer and more quantitative outlook as those plans shape up. But we \n","are mindful of our intention to reduce the capital intensity of these investments \n","over time. \n"," \n","Kenneth Dorell:  Great. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time. And we look\n","forward to speaking again soon. \n"," \n","Operator:  And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining us.
