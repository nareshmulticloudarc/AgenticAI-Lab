ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, installment term lengths and eligible products. See the [Apple Card Customer Agreement](https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Apple-Card-Customer-Agreement.pdf) for more information about ACMI.

Apple reports data about the recycled content of its products at different levels of fidelity, based on the level of independent data verification. The bulk of Apple’s recycled content data is certified and thus verified by an independent third party. Less than 5% ofthe total mass shipped in Apple products in fiscal year 2022 contains recycled content that is either supplier verified, meaning it has been reported by the supplier and cross-checked by Apple, or supplier reported, meaning it has been reported by the supplier based on production and allocation values. In all cases, Apple defines recycled content in alignment with ISO 14021. We do not currently include industry-average recycled content, which may result in underreporting actual recycled content. Total recycled material shipped in products is driven by product material composition and total sales —as a result, this overall recycled or renewable content percentage may fluctuate basedon the number and type of products sold each year.\\n\\n8. Based on sales-weighted averages of Mac, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV, HomePod, AirPods and Beats.\\n\\n9. Apple’s goal to eliminate plastic from packaging includes retail bags, all finished goods boxes (including plastic content in labels and in-box documentation), packaging sent to our customers as part of Apple Trade In, AppleCare packaging for whole units and service modules (with the exception of plastics needed to protect items from electrostatic discharge), and secondary packaging of Apple products and accessories sold by Apple. Our goal does not include the inks, coatings, or adhesives used in our packaging. Responsible sourcing of wood fiber is defined in [Apple’s Responsible Fiber Specification](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Responsible_Fiber_Specification_June2023.pdf).
