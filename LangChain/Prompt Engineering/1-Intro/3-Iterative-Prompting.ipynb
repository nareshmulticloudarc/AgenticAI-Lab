Make sure to use an oven thermometer to ensure your oven is at the right temperature.\n","2. **Prepare the cake pan:** Grease the cake pan with non-stick cooking spray or line it with parchment paper.\n","3. **Mix the dry ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n","4. **Mix the wet ingredients:** In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the sugar and butter until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.\n","5. **Add the eggs:** Beat in the eggs one at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.\n","6. **Add the vanilla extract:** Beat in the vanilla extract.\n","7. **Alternate the wet and dry ingredients:** With the mixer on low speed, alternately add the flour mixture and milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Beat just until combined.\n","8. **Scrape down the bowl:** Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula to ensure all ingredients are well incorporated.\n","9. **Pour the batter:** Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top.\n","10. **Bake the cake:** Bake the cake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n","11. **Let the cake cool:** Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.\n","\n","**Tips and Variations:**\n","\n","* Use room temperature ingredients for a tender crumb.\n","* Don't overmix the batter, as this can result in a dense cake.\n","* If you want to add flavorings or mix-ins, such as nuts or chocolate chips, fold them into the batter after step 7.\n","* To ensure the cake is fully cooked, check it with a toothpick or a cake tester.\n","* If you're not using a non-stick cake pan, make sure to grease it well to prevent the cake from sticking.\n","\n","**Common Cake Baking Issues:**\n","\n","* Cake is too dense: Overmixing or using old baking powder.\n","* Cake is too dry: Overbaking or using too little liquid.\n","* Cake is too wet: Underbaking or using too much liquid.\n","\n","By following these steps and tips, you should be able to bake a delicious and moist cake.
